An honest man, he carries himself as though held down by the weight of the world. Dora is a cleaning lady, struggling to get by any way she can. Dealt a rough hand in life, she has developed a rich layer of cynicism and mistrust that informs her every action. When a man Sotiris believes is innocent is arrested for a brutal crime, his attempt to uncover the truth results in a grave mistake. Finding himself on the other side of the law for the first time, he places his fate in Dora, the only witness to his malfeasance and the only person who can help him, for better or for worse.","popularity":2.18,"poster_path":"/bPnSo2xNl9e2nXbgIBAxeRECvJh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unfair World","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6}
