But a decisive win over the Cowboys earned the Giants a division crown on the final day of the season. Once in the playoffs, Big Blue took down the Falcons, Packers and 49ers to reach the Super Bowl for the second time under head coach Tom Coughlin. And in that rematch of Super Bowl XLII, the results were the same: Another Giant upset over the favored New England Patriots.","popularity":1.215,"poster_path":"/fg1wrEtCH0UyS0k6wBS2qYUlfLR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3232,"logo_path":"/8KtxMsWLOK6zDTNAfi75yg2QvSt.png","name":"NFL Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Super Bowl XLVI Champions - New York Giants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
