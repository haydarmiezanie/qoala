After two Audi R18 TDI cars have retired following spectacular accidents, the remaining Audi fights a dramatic battle for overall victory with the three Peugeot 908 cars which the Audi trio ultimately decides in its favor with a narrow margin of 13 seconds. The film captures the entire drama of the fourth-narrowest running of the Le Mans 24 Hours with intimate insights into the team of Audi Sport and breath-taking pictures.","popularity":2.61,"poster_path":"/7sycIw5sg6zqHzdI8DColwDjTdI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Intersport Television","origin_country":""},{"id":3232,"logo_path":"/8KtxMsWLOK6zDTNAfi75yg2QvSt.png","name":"NFL Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Truth In 24 II: Every Second Counts","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":8}
