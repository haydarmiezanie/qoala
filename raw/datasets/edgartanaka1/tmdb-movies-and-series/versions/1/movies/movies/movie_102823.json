While Migue and Mara make love on a rooftop, Ahmed, a Moroccan kid who's come to Spain thinking it full of money and nude women, goes to get beer. As he leaves the bodega, a fancy car pulls up, men jump out. Ahmed shouts up to Migue, who slips on shoes and runs. The chase across the rooftops involves leaps, flights of fantasy that take us back. The fearful shout of Mara becomes the cry of Migue's mother years before. A brick of hashish stolen from a fat man brings them cash for a celebration. Beer and sex: life doesn't get any better.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wDTFzQMctItxQeSaCynXklmM3fa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2002-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bamboleho","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
