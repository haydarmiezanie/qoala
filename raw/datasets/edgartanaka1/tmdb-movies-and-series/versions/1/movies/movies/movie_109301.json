The violin princess and the saxophone prince fall in love, but must meet secretly in order to avoid the wrath of their parents, the Symphony queen and the Jazz king. The queen finds the boy saxophone on her island, attempting to woo her daughter. She has him locked in the metronome, but the young lover manages to send a note - in fact, several musical notes on sheet music - that conveys the message that he has been imprisoned. The Isle of Jazz declares war by blasting musical notes across the sea. The only thing that can bring peace and harmony to the Sea of Discord is love.","popularity":4.935,"poster_path":"/ygmrU2F2JwUtjpn6EBOrRq0pKCD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":60,"logo_path":"/oJXpAs4I3W46e4dkaOEzCa4yBko.png","name":"United Artists","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Simply Spellbinding Silly Symphony!","title":"Music Land","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":24}
