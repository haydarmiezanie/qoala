He has concentrated on the narrative without deviating from the plot by inserting songs.  Performance wise, Sarath has done a neat job in a role that doesn't have much of heroism. He scores in intense scenes and excels in action sequences.  However, there is no big challenge in his role and hence the impact of the role too is limited.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vaitheeswaran","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
