We follow a group of young men that can't seem to get ahead, despite their willingness to try. Then one hits upon a plane - to work together to save for a dump truck and thus become independent contractors and be their own bosses at last. Ultimately life presents obstacles: jail for one, violence at the hands of the police for another and a girlfriend and subsequent children for the third. An early Kinji Fukasaku gem that imports the freewheeling style of the French New Wave and the hip detachment of American noir.","popularity":1.977,"poster_path":"/jSahCCg9UO40SeHTTQtpvHV9XZV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22677,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bungakuza","origin_country":""},{"id":74278,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shinsei Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If You Were Young: Rage","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":5}
