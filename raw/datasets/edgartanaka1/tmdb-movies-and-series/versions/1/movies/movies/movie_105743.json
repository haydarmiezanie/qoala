Assigned to Soviet film-maker Sergei Eisenstein, the filming followed the same path as with his previous effort, \"Que Viva Mexico\", into cost overrun and over-shooting of footage.  Furthermore, Eisenstein's usage of forbidden experimental film techniques outraged his government superiors, who ordered the film destroyed before it was even completed.  Some footage survived, however, and was eventually compiled for presentation to the public in the 1970s.","popularity":1.839,"poster_path":"/tkzxPNzPlfgV38FJqNrudRg6xa1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111284,"logo_path":null,"name":"State Cinematography Department","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1937-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bezhin Meadow: Sequences from an Unfinished Film","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":15}
