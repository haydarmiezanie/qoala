When impulsive Koni savagely attacks a visiting government official, the resulting massacre forces the two friends on a journey that will transform them from boys into men, from farmers into soldiers and from villagers into revolutionaries. \"We fight in one world so we can live in another,\" declares Koni as the two battle shoulder to shoulder against government troops. But while Koni embraces the politics and carnage of their dangerous new guerilla existence, Djimi longs for the simplicity and grace of the village life they've left behind. As the rebels move closer to victory, the two friends move closer to a clash of their own.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pierre Javaux Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":76601,"logo_path":null,"name":"DCN","origin_country":""},{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":76602,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parenthese Films","origin_country":""},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TD","name":"Chad"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daresalam","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
