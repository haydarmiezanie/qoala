The collapse of the U.S. economy is the result of conscious choices made over thirty five years by a small group: leaders of corporations and their elected allies, and the biggest lobbying interest in Washington, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. To these individuals, the collapse is not a catastrophe, but rather the planned outcome of their long, patient work. For the rest of the country, it is merely the biggest heist in American history.","popularity":3.095,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heist: Who Stole the American Dream?","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":4}
