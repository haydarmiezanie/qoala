A law avidly adhered to by the inhabitants of a small village, who collect the space debris that falls downrange from the nearby Baikonur space station.  The last two youthful members of the village are the radio operator Iskander, known as Gagarin, and the spirited Nazira. While Nazira finds it increasing difficult to conceal her love for Iskander by means of her unconventional behaviour, Iskander is evidently not only crazy about Baikonur and the vastness of outer space, but also deeply smitten with the beautiful French astronaut Julie Mahé, whose journey to the stars he wistfully follows on television.","popularity":2.036,"poster_path":"/1DZleUxHcqRXPdhg4FYQ0sOdtUm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2132,"logo_path":"/pXSDWOBpCn2HHnR1SXhTqE2iWfR.png","name":"Veit Helmer-Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2011-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baikonur","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":14}
