Mahmoud is close to despair when he meets Reem, a divorcee and modern-thinker who works in advertising. Reem is a fervent ecologist who first comes to Mahmoud’s rundown neighbourhood to care for the camels and horses that have been left to fend for themselves. Their encounter develops into a love story that will radically change the course of their lives forever.","popularity":1.387,"poster_path":"/v8kneI2UaQFHtoFGrRPt4biMl8Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2577,"logo_path":"/QZ4zbeJ0sULzGNJvfukrzgx4d8.png","name":"Studio 37","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8668,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Century Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France 3 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"2012-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Battle","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":4}
