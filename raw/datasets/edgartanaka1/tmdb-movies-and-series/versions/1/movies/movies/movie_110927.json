In his class, Ivan is provoked by a student and ends up slapping him on the face. In Serbia, in the heat of transitional changes, Ivan’s presence in school is no longer welcomed. He finds a temporary job opportunity in a war-scarred mountain village in Bosnia.  On his way there, he meets Yasmina, a young Muslim woman, back from Germany to her homeland after the war and after being invited by an old friend – Hazim - who now runs a motel.  A lone kiss in a stormy night, in a village still lying in ruins, will bring Yasmina and Ivan closer together in a joint escape from reality and to a ride on a dusty bus, where neither one of them wants to sit next to the window.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Komuna","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":68800,"logo_path":null,"name":"Association for Visual Culture","origin_country":""},{"id":68801,"logo_path":null,"name":"VizArt","origin_country":"BA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2011-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"},{"iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Motel Nana","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":3}
