He falls for Lola, an opium-addicted, alcoholic whore who's hopelessly in love with Gardenia Wilson, a masked wrestler who slept with her once but knows she's unbalanced. Don Lázaro warns Nacho about Lola, and Nacho knows his love will be unrequited, but he'll do anything, regardless of how degrading, to be near her. Lola, for her part, can be sadistic. Republican exiles who are regulars at the café encourage Lola's desire to assassinate Franco. Nacho in turn mixes this political mirage with his fascination with the plot of \"The Mikado.\" Where do fantasies and obsessions lead?","popularity":2.236,"poster_path":"/z8YEbm7iim2treKlmEoZfxEmxCV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":732,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mate Producciones S.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":9980,"logo_path":"/9pLJAcyas8aUyVq0mwbv2EMQmgW.png","name":"Fondo para la Producción Cinematográfica de Calidad","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":16422,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fado Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":299,"logo_path":"/elssmtHcogGtF8Gxokh9phZvLKi.png","name":"Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2002-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Virgin of Lust","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
