Was it made for kids? Hard to say. A fleshy egg pops out of the pregnant queen, weird demons plague the kingdom, evil sorcerers try to take over, the hero fights with a weird bloody body. This film is low-budget, and if that's a plus for you, check it out. The sets are wonderful and the special effects are very funny (the dwarves are regular-sized actors, shot from above). Most of the effects involve optical-printing, which wasn't done very skillfully, so the sequences are a little out of focus. Nevertheless, this is one of the most entertaining kung-fu movies I've ever seen. The soundtrack consists of the themes to Battlestar Galactica, Starblazers, and some 80s P-funk.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13971,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lusty Electric Industries","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Thrilling Sword","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
