He always longed to have his own church and jumps at the opportunity to become pastor of the impoverished Divine Faith Apostolic Church in Atlanta. His wife and two children arenâ€™t very enthusiastic about his assignment. Neither is the congregation itself, but they will have to learn to trust each other and pull together to save the church from a corrupt banker anxious to foreclose. It will take a musical miracle, supplied by BeBe Winans himself, to save them all in this heartfelt, family-friendly comedy.","popularity":2.83,"poster_path":"/pe8p9WrOKMw1zdphk2TBwxTkOCj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6427,"logo_path":"/73gMvgccXNJLd5E6VKJzuHT1Ik0.png","name":"Pure Flix Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"All things are possible when you believe","title":"Brother White","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
