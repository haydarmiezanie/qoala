The film focuses on the connection between private capital and government in Israel and suggests that a system exists whereby the State of Israel sells its limited resources, cheaply, to a handful of wealthy families. The film shows this by specifically focusing on the business relationship between the political leadership in Israel and one of the wealthiest families in the Israeli economy – the Ofer family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m334WxTplhOWi2JvXwCO59PxKe1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2008-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The movie nobody wants you to see","title":"The Shakshuka Method","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
