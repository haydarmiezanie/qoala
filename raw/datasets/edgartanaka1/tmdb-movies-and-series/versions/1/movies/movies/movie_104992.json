This training, however, takes much less time than it would in most martial arts films, in which the kid would attain mastery at about the same time he reaches adulthood. Instead what we get is a sword-wielding 5 year old waging a bloody war of revenge against an assortment of adult-sized demons and people in heartbreakingly threadbare monster costumes.","popularity":0.953,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":90161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tang Man Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dwarf Sorcerer","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
