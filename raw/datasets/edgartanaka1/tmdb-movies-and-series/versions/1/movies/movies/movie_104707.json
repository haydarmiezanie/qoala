Dressed as waiters, Kapa and Pepe awake in the bronze chariot of the millennial sculpture group. They drive along the Danube promenade, and on the concrete reinforcement of the demolished Budapest rondella hotel they get involved in a showdown of political background. In the burnt-down Sports Hall the waiters train for a last supper, Pepe and Kapa run around the big laid table with trays in their hands. While doing so, Pepe keeps crying out: \"I am the best one, I am the most beautiful one, I am the king, I am the god...\" Sitting in a boat on the Danube, a ship goes past them, and the Niagara falls, majestic and breathtaking, resound in their ears. On each passing away something new will come to life – as rapped by Sub Bass Monster.","popularity":1.965,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neurópa Film Kft","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2001-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Supper at the Arabian Gray Horse","video":false,"vote_average":3.1,"vote_count":5}
