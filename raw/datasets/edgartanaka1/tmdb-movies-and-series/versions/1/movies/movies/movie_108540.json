Wilson is co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, a man included in TIME Magazine's \"100 Persons of the 20th Century.\" Interviews, recreations, and rare archival material reveal how Bill Wilson, a hopeless drunk near death from his alcoholism, found a way out of his own addiction and then forged a path for countless others to follow. With Bill as its driving force, A.A. grew from a handful of men to a worldwide fellowship of over 2 million men and women - a success that made him an icon within A.A., but also an alcoholic unable to be a member of the very society he had created. A reluctant hero, Bill Wilson lived a life of sacrifice and service, and left a legacy that continues every day, all around the world.","popularity":1.191,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill W.","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
