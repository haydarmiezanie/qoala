Pepe marries into a family of mafiosi, with the father-in-law rolling in money. In a joint venture they establish the first Hungarian Prison Limited company, where there is a menu, the prisoners are residents, and they furnish the place of execution for those volunteering to execute themselves. It turns out that the first voluntary hanging should be demonstrated on Pepe. In 180 AD Emperor Marcus Aurelius is dying in Vindobona, being fed with blades of hay by uncle Miki himself, and his son Kornél Mundruczó. Kapa provides for communication: he insists on telling lies, lies and again lies. Furthermore, there are several to die and to revive, to win and to lose, and Melancholy Béla is still alive.","popularity":2.012,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2006-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ed's Eaten Elevenses","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":4}
