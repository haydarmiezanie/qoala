Original and never-before-seen footage documents his self-made journey to iconic garage rock star, with colleagues, friends, and family speaking candidly about Jay's vibrant and complicated life. Jay Reatard himself - filmed just nine months before his untimely death at the age of twenty-nine - shares his experiences both on and off stage, with all the humor, savvy, and pathos one can expect from such a prolific and vital artist.","popularity":1.353,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Better Than Something: Jay Reatard","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":5}
