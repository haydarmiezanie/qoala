Like New York itself, hip-hop music encompassed both of these human conditions. But hip-hop and its cultural birthplace shared other important characteristics, too: the desire to always be original, a hustle-to-survive ambition, and — if the stars aligned — the ability to come out on top, no matter what the odds.  Big Fun in the Big Town is about hip-hop when artistry in the game was still at its center. When skills, not hype, got you your first record deal. When Run-DMC took the reins from Doug E Fresh and Grandmaster Flash, paving the way for hundreds of other hitmakers to follow. When a chart-topping LL Cool J still lived with his Grandmother. When the Latin Quarter was the club to be at on any weekend night. And when artists from all backgrounds could taste their own pop chart dreams, just beyond their reach but still seemingly attainable.","popularity":1.49,"poster_path":"/ea0yf9vpc6RGOKedWoginQ9wf9J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Fun in the Big Town","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
