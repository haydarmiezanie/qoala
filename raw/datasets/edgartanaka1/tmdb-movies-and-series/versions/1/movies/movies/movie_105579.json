Hokusai lives in poverty, apprenticed as a printmaker, studying under the best artists of the day, especially Korin. Hokusai's unique style strives for realism. The camera slowly pans Hokusai's art: we see prints popular with merchants and commoners, particularly his caricatures; his subjects are often people at work. Late in life, political turmoil becomes his subject.","popularity":2.967,"poster_path":"/wnAlccugpHyhvoLfDev3cQtSxza.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10490,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seinen Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hokusai","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":10}
