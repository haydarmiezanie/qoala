These youths were the rebel generation who were also searching for an identity. They created a music - a sub genre of reggae known as Lovers Rock. This music became a global brand through artists like UB40 and Maxi Priest. The music brought a level of intimacy between young people that was unique. It was also 'girl power' music that empowered a generation of young women. Through comedy, live performance, dance, interviews and archive the film takes you back to an untold era of British cultural, music and political history.","popularity":3.45,"poster_path":"/mn5OhTIElXrnOjyfUs2QUW5EIyH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Secret World of a Generation and the Birth of a Reggae Genre","title":"The Story of Lovers Rock","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
