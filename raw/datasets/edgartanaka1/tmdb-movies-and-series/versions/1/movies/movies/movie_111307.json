Hungry and desperate for a break, Chick fortuitously comes across across a valise abandoned by a drunken traveler. In it he finds a shaving kit and a suit of clothes with a bankroll, which help transform the affable tramp into a dashing gent. After buying himself a meal, Chick seeks some female companionship among the many hustlers who walk the station. He propositions Ruth Collins, a stranded, out-of-work showgirl and takes her to the station's hotel.","popularity":1.293,"poster_path":"/r9ujw92xMRPQ7dFH6rzKzbenuhs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1932-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Lifetime Crowded Into a Few Mad Hours!
