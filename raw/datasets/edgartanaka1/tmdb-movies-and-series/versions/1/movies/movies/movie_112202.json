The film's first half dramatizes the New Testament's \"Acts\": early fear, the renewal of Pentecost, Saul's conversion, the decision to baptize pagans, and the Apostles' dispersal. In the second half, an aged Peter goes to Rome to join Paul, arriving on the day of Paul's arrest. Paul's death brings a crisis to Rome's Christians and to Peter; lessons from Jesus's teachings guide his decision to stay. Events within the fictive household of Persius, a Roman aristocrat, capture the upheaval that Christian teachings bring to the Eternal City.","popularity":6.079,"poster_path":"/qT7jgld6QuGlI4QvqgbteyfI9Tb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2005-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The salvation of many.
