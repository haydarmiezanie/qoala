Then he can find out who really murdered his wife. She was a magician's assistant, who fell miserably in love with her boss. Now she runs a remote restaurant on the windswept coast of South Korean's Jeju island. Their paths cross after he escapes from prison, visiting the young woman at the request of a fellow inmate. She gives him a job as a chef, and they begin to get closer. Despite the relaxing seaside idyll and the ray of hope shining down on the characters' stark lives, happiness is forbidden them. A nationwide police search has begun for the fugitive and the inescapable threat of death from AIDS hangs over him every moment like a shadow.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/km4vK2l2X2gawWRCwo0kXJQL908.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opus Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"At the edge of life, love was all they had","title":"Lovers Vanished","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
