The narrator also cautions moviegoers against spreading rumors (which are often initiated by enemy infiltrators to create fear and dissention) and believing everything they read in the newspapers. Just because \"they say\" something, that doesn't make it true.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/sazoz4UYzC4j5sXUHiv5E9GpZMz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/mjofSXiHpG5t6KYmU4l4FrUhT7m.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Blabbermouth!","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
