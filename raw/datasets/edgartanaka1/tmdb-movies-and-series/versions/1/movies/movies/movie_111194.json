The ladies move in bag and baggage into a sleepy suburban community. Before long, every husband in the vicinity has fallen for their charms. A few trousers have fallen as well, which is why the film carries an R rating. The Girls Next Door is worth watching for an early performance by TV favorite Perry Lang.","popularity":2.198,"poster_path":"/73mTb3fWahPB4wNrCkXXduavhQc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65907,"logo_path":null,"name":"Columbus America","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You think about it all the time...And so does she!","title":"Teen Lust","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
