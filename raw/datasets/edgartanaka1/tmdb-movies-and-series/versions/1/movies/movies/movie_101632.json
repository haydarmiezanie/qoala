You'll also sit shotgun and follow Rob, Matt, and Shivam on another epic high speed ticket fest on a rally from New York to Las Vegas.

Strap in and get ready for another wild ride.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Super Speeders 6 - Flat Out","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
