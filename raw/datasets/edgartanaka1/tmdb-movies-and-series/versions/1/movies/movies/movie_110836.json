He wanders into the desert wastelands and joins an outlaw gang who prey on gold prospectors. Years later, he meets his wife and her gold-prospecting father as they have come there seeking their fortune, and not knowing the danger of the treacherous desert wastes, the poisoned-water holes and the outlaw bands of marauders who roam the desert in search of the gold found by others. He comes to their aid and, eventually, manges to clear his name of the false charge against him.","popularity":1.461,"poster_path":"/fxOYE9u7cU6f8FDHQ1aFdiQ0aqw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/fycMZt242LVjagMByZOLUGbCvv3.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wanderer of the Wasteland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
