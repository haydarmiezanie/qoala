The bird then magically takes the form of a beautiful lady named Hsiao-Hseuh, played by Cherie Chung, who falls in love with the scholar because he had saved her life. She returns the deed by rescuing him from a ruthless band of warlords. She and her sister, Hsiao-Shang, are both originally swallows, but can change into human forms due to witchcraft and wizardry. Hsiao-Hseuh later confronts Chih-Chiu, and later reveals she is a servant of an evil witch queen, who feeds on human blood. When the witch discovers their friendship and bond, she was on the verge of destroying him, but Hsiao-Hseuh pleads for his life in exchange for their separation. After being back in the custody of the witch queen, Hsiao-Hseuh sneaks out and reunites with Chih-Chiu, but posing as a different person to hide her identity.","popularity":1.246,"poster_path":"/tZ5PDBL6CDqw57FX3Ym5FpMj9x2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23450,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alan and Eric Films Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golden Swallow","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
