The participants in the 2007 final were incumbent champions England and South Africa.  The match itself was try-less with each team scoring only penalties. This gave South Africa a 15â€“6 victory. It also meant that of the five countries to have appeared in a Rugby World Cup final, South Africa is the only one that has not lost a final, and the only one not to have scored a try at the final stage. Each team did have one major try scoring opportunity; South Africa's came late in the first half, while England's came early in the second. England wing Mark Cueto was denied a try in the 42nd minute after he was ruled to have put a foot in touch during a tackle by Danie Rossouw before grounding the ball after a TMO review. Later independent analysis showed this to be the correct decision.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Final 2007 Rugby World Cup","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
