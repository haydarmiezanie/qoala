He meets a lama, a holy man, and devotes himself to his tending. But when British administrators discover his birthright, he is placed in a British school. His nature, however, is opposed to the regimentation expected for the son of a British soldier, and he rebels. His familiarity with Indian life and his ability to pass as an Indian child allows him to function as a spy for the British as they attempt to thwart revolution and invasion of India. Rejoining his holy man, Kim (with the help of daring adventurer Mahbub Ali) takes on a dangerous mission.","popularity":3.385,"poster_path":"/txr9NnUNOnJ6WKoi0I451nsUSAF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/mjofSXiHpG5t6KYmU4l4FrUhT7m.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Famed Spectacular Adventure Story Filmed Against Authentic Backgrounds in Mystic India The Greatest Spy Thriller of Them All!","title":"Kim","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":14}
