Minerva gets into trouble a lot, and her Aunt Hermione threatens to take her away from Uncle Howie. Paul Reiser plays Dexter, a professor who figures out a way to win every time at blackjack. Dexter gets caught at cheating, and Uncle Howie works out a deal for Dexter to tutor Minerva so she can get into a private school back east. This is easier said than done, because Minerva has never been interested in school.","popularity":1.05,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Minerva","title":"You Ruined My Life","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":3}
