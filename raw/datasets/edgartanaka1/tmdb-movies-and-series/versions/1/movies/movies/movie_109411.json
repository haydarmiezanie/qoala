Leroy, confined in a small cell with the enemy, far from the KKK comrades who deserted him, finds the chatty Emilio slowly chipping away at his anger and prejudice. His weekly rehabilitation meetings with the warden, barely tolerable as the man drones on about farm labor and field crops, take on a different meaning when Madalena, a beautiful Mexican maid is hired to clean the warden's office. An unconventional love story develops that opens Leroy's eyes to the possibility of a different life. And a man who was a born and bred racist finds himself heading down a completely different path to salvation.","popularity":3.565,"poster_path":"/nRBPIL0DSTX1pTGUj1OQQ2dmViD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cellmates","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":7}
