She soon becomes the center of attention, since so many of her new friends are curious to know about the recent death of a student at her old school in the North. She blames it on a mysterious phone number - 999-9999 - a number reputed to grant whoever calls it, one wish. Her classmate apparently had called the number and had his wish granted...soon after, he was found dead on a flagpole. Despite Rainbow's repeated warnings, many of her new classmates decide to try this out. Although the various wishes are fulfilled, a series of accident-like deaths occur, until Sun becomes the only teen in the group left alive. Death is awaiting him, however, as he has also made a wish which has yet to be fulfilled. Together, Rainbow and Sun must solve the mystery of the evil phone number, and stop whatever it is from killing them.","popularity":2.647,"poster_path":"/zGab9MHuWy9lVP31LraG2tPjqXB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4206,"logo_path":"/pWUbIYoZDsvOD1yT0FzfYetWBxL.png","name":"Baa-Ram-Ewe","origin_country":"TH"},{"id":4207,"logo_path":"/v5BSFwIXQmZEO16bClILNrbv4Kl.png","name":"Sahamongkolfilm","origin_country":"TH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"999-9999","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":11}
