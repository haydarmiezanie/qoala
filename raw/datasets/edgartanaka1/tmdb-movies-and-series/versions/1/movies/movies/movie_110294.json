Return To Forever hit their commercial and artistic peak with a string of albums in the mid-seventies featuring the line-up of Chick Corea on keyboards, Stanley Clarke on bass, Al Di Meola on guitar and Lenny White on drums. In 2008 this classic line-up reunited for their first tour in 25 years and proved that their musicianship and the chemistry within the band were as strong as ever.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/3sQ3r6ML20AuqWanRa99cRvPa6X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Music - Jazz","title":"Return To Forever: Live At Montreux 2008","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":4}
