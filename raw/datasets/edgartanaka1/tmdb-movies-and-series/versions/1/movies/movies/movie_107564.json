Amarnath is attracted to his daughter, Chanda, and both get intimate. Amarnath promises to return, but never does. About 25 years later, Amarnath returns to Darjeeling, driving an expensive Mercedes, hoping to relax. He casually makes inquiries about Chanda and her father, and finds out that Harihar passed away long ago; Chanda got pregnant and was hastily married to a aged and invalid man, gave birth to a baby girl, subsequently became insane, and died. He also finds out that Chanda sent her daughter, Kajli, away to another town to study and become a doctor. Amarnath is shocked and full of guilt at the injustice and anguish he has caused Chanda and her family. Then he gets to meet Kajli, who is not studying medicine - but earning her living in a brothel - as a foul-mouthed prostitute.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1975-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mausam","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
