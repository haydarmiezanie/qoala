After Miller died in a local bar Scranton, at the age of 62, filmmaker and fellow Scranton native Rebecca Marshall Ferris set out with her camera to find out why did this exceptional playwright, who achieved such phenomenal early success, never write a Broadway play again? And what happened to Miller in Hollywood that would make him run away from a promising acting career?","popularity":2.11,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's difficult getting to the top; it's more difficult staying there.","title":"Miller's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":4}
