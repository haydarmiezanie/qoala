This full-length documentary film on Charles and David Koch—two of the world’s richest and most powerful men—is the latest from acclaimed director Robert Greenwald (Wal-Mart: the High Cost of Low Price, Outfoxed, Rethink Afghanistan). The billionaire brothers bankroll a vast network of organizations that work to undermine the interests of the 99% on issues ranging from Social Security to the environment to civil rights. This film uncovers the Kochs’ corruption—and points the way to how Americans can reclaim their democracy.","popularity":1.142,"poster_path":"/wQytlNtUVOzkZEsJJRtB7vjeeKj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4971,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brave New Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Koch Brothers Exposed","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
