Meanwhile, he and his partners (including that versatile Wong Jing) go to work for the dastardly Lung Fong, who’s a top gang boss in Shenzen. He hires Nobody to swindle high-rollers at his Shenzen casino. However, things go to hell when Candy’s dad (Hui Siu-Hung) arrives at the casino with stolen money from Candy’s account - which was supposed to pay for her eye surgery.  Nobody helps out Pop, but that sets in motion a series of events that can only be described as harrowing. Nobody goes down in a big way and he attempts to struggle back, even invoking the classic line “I want to get back what I lost.” Cue Better Tomorrow theme music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eqDuyUNiQoW2stLg6DBtrn4m5mI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26703,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jing's Production Limited","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2000-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Name Is Nobody","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
