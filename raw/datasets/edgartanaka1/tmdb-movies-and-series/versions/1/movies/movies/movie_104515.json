The author and the film director walk among them all the time, contemplating, laughing at their plays. The stories starting from the graveyard and returning there warn of the inevitability of death. The author and the director (Gyula Hernádi and Miklós Jancsó) wisely make friends with death.","popularity":3.881,"poster_path":"/6RDZA23EkmcJoNhshkqXtlEdcvE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1999-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ha én állat lennék, nem tartanék embert a lakásban...","title":"The Lord's Lantern in Budapest","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
