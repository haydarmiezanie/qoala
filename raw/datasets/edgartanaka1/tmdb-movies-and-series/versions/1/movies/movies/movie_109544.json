Inspired by the writings of David Henry Thoreau, he is translating 'Civil Disobedience' into Portuguese. The action is set between 1908 and 1910, between the assassination of the Portuguese King and Prince and the creation of the Portuguese Republic, an era where anarchists who fight against the monarchy often cross the path of burglars. On a country where corruption is set, the state representatives try to rob, arrest and kill innocents. The main character faces the tyranny of the state and tries to save the rest of his family. But this is a country where nothing changes.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":93392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cimbalino Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":16464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bando à Parte","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2012-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Estrada de Palha","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
