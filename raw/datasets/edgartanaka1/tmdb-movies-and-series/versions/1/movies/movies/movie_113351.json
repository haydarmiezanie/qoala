All the way along its 2,716 miles, we pass places that testify to the country’s tumultuous history, and encounter the ghosts of those who shaped its destiny: Stanley, the explorer, Leopold II, the colonizer, Mobutu, the despot. We also cross paths with an entire people – boatmen guiding their dugout canoes, fishermen, traveling salesmen, military personnel and rebels, women and children – searching for light and dignity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2005-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"iso_639_1":"ln","name":""},{"iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Congo River","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
