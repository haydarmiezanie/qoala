This documentary details the root causes of the systemic value disorders and detrimental symptoms caused by our current established system.  The film advocates a new socio-economic system, which is updated to present-day knowledge, featuring the life-long work of Social Engineer, Futurist, Inventor and Industrial Designer Jacques Fresco, which he calls a Resource-Based Economy.  Paradise or Oblivion by the Venus Project introduces the viewer to a more appropriate value system that would be required to enable this caring and holistic approach to hhuman civilisation.  This alternative surpasses the need for a monetary-based, controlled scarcity environment we find ourselves in today.","popularity":2.806,"poster_path":"/uNRY0BoeZLg9jSkVnl6WZTCcSKg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise or Oblivion","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":8}
