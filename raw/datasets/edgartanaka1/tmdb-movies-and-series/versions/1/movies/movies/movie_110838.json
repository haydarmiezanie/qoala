A woman, perhaps the Madonna, brings forth her baby to a crowd of intrusive paparazzi; she tries to flee them. Two men who are lovers marry and are arrested by the powers that be. The men are mocked and pilloried, tarred, feathered, and beaten. Loose in this contemporary world of electrical-power transmission lines is also Jesus. The elements, particularly fire and water, content with political power, which is intolerant and murderous.","popularity":4.817,"poster_path":"/sDeEZAdPFwzTUEp8Ba9M8Naw2dG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":12745,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Screen Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":27903,"logo_path":null,"name":"Basilisk Communications","origin_country":""},{"id":27904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uplink","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":66411,"logo_path":null,"name":"Space Shower TV","origin_country":""},{"id":93400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sohbi Kikaku","origin_country":""},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1990-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Garden","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":15}
