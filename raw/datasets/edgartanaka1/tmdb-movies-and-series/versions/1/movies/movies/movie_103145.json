Over the course of 66 days and nights, Lasker shoots a fly-on-the-wall documentary that allows unprecedented intimacy into the lives of the trainees and commanders of the Israeli army. The dichotomy of the innocence of these baby-faced trainees with the heavy burden of military service is a central theme of the film, illustrated in a scene where they discuss losing their virginity while waiting their turn to fire a machine gun. But it is the director’s relationship with Smadar, a breathtaking commander struggling to mask her gentle soul with a strict military persona, which makes the film truly enchanting. The intersection of love, duty, and personal growth thrive through to the film’s surprisingly moving finish.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seeds of Summer","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
