These are not the YOJIMBO Super Samurai but rather the rank and file, the spear-carriers. The irony is that even though they use the servants' entrance, they still feel themselves bound by the samurai code of Bushido; and this tension leads to tragedy.","popularity":1.464,"poster_path":"/4yk1GmixJaWp49VQGR8QH6QxgU2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9181,"logo_path":"/hObQEBMY8Es6ajSlVeBEIdqbuSK.png","name":"Art Theatre Guild","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":111114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kon Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1973-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wanderers","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
