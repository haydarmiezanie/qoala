Kadee Worth, on the other hand, is the daughter of music mogul Reginald Worth and is an international pop phenomenon. While the world knows her as a glamorous superstar, she is secretly frustrated with singing other people's songs and wearing clothes other people choose for her.

Despite every obstacle that gets thrown in their way, once Charlie and Kadee find one another, they each finally get what they have been looking for â€“ a voice, a stage, an audience and each other.","popularity":9.712,"poster_path":"/5CfrXWMeGcMlisL1YRCgpFMWiER.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rags","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":95}
