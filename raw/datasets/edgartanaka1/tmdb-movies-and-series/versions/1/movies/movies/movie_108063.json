On the one hand, its anti-war sentiments are clear, as well as its realistic scenarios of destruction, and on the other hand, the director and scripter Cesar Zavatini have turned the story into a satire. At the center of focus is a young couple who were getting married when the atomic bombs changed the face of the planet, and through the couple's own dilemma the greater picture is glimpsed. Assisting Eva Krizevska, Anton Vrdoljak, Zlatko Madunic, and other actors is President Marshal Tito's army.","popularity":2.394,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168,"logo_path":"/AmNSNdDaByDpc0bzekWFeYRXDW2.png","name":"Jadran Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"1960-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atomic War Bride","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
