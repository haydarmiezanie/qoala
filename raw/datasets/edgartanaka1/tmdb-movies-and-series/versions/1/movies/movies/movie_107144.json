Not Jim and Jamie Dutcher. Raising a pack of gray wolves from puppies, they were able to film their growth, development, and changing behavior. Wolves at Our Door, the sequel to Wolf: Return of a Legend, explores these beautiful animals as they live in America's Northwest. Excellent footage captures the wolves playing with each other and with the Dutchers and allows us a glimpse into another world, one that's not so scary after all. You're sure to see these marvelous beasts differently after watching Wolves at Our Door. --Rob Lightner","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/635v1p3riqsI6HhzCLsvvQYyKvg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolves at Our Door","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
