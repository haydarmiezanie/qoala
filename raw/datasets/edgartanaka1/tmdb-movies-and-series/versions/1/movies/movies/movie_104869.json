In the Russian film \"Satan,\" the devil is a delicately handsome young man whose murderous opportunism is too easy to understand. While the film registers shock at its protagonist's absolute amorality, it also presents him as part of a bitterly divided and pessimistic culture. The world of \"Satan\" is one in which nothing really works, and therefore anything goes.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/86wj1YzB8JETlPwT69AXyd3fSh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tak-T","origin_country":""},{"id":10845,"logo_path":"/b8N0K4dvM6CNG9OE5v1lLh5bSb3.png","name":"Lenfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1991-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satan","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":4}
