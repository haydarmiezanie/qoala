Wellman adds another to his long line of salutes-to-aviation films in this bio of an aviation pioneer, John Montgomery (Glenn Ford.) In 1883 he built a practical glider despite the opposition of his friends, who thought he was crazy, and of his family, who were afraid that his dreams of flying would hurt his father's political ambitions. He pursues his education at Santa Clara University where the Jesuits lend a helping and understanding hand. An earthquake destroys what appears to be a working model for an airplane, but a gold-sorting machine Montgomery invented, and then neglected, promises to provide for his financial needs to keep working on his aircraft until he gets involved in costly lawsuits defending his invention.","popularity":3.164,"poster_path":"/2LFqbit9dvY3n9vuSzp0YqaOJNh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One Of The World's Most Exciting Adventures!","title":"Gallant Journey","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
