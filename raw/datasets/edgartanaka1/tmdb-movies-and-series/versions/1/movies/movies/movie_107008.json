She is of the belief that Fernando is single, living with his ailing mother. This, of course, is far from the case.  The boys living in her apartment building mistakenly believe Luisa is a call-girl who uses piano teaching as a cover for her true profession, and word soon spreads among the building's dirty old men. The resourceful boys drill a well-concealed hole in the wall between Signorina Luisa's flat and the bedroom of the landlord's son, Marcello Busatti, allowing them a spectacular view of their spectacular neighbor.  Marcello quickly becomes infatuated with Luisa, but is also conflicted regarding her supposed profession. Eventually Luisa learns of Fernando's philandering nature, and after a vigorous misunderstanding, satisfies Marcello's unrequited lust/love.","popularity":6.608,"poster_path":"/2dL4pCNC8iRpMjEHoBrUDClfbxt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Jacques Leitienne","origin_country":""},{"id":9152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Devon Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":15868,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medusa Distribuzione","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1978-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"School Teacher in the House","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":31}
