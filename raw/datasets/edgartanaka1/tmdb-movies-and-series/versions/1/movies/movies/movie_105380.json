They formed Strapped, an organization determined to find a way to safely ride these monster waves, and developed tow-in surfing--a technique which allows these fearless wave riders to stand up to some of the biggest waves in the world. This documentary explains their technique, and shows them in action--set to the sounds of U2, Mint Royale, Endo, Soil, and Grand Theft Auto.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strapped: The Origins of Tow-In Surfing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
