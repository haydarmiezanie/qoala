Two filmmakers explore a controversial theory about the beginnings of the disease. Using interviews, newsreel footage, and documented research experiments, The Origin of AIDS examines how a combination of benevolence, careless lab procedures, and the need of a desperate few to cover their tracks could have led to one of the most serious pandemics of the 20th century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vnpAd5hW14NGxhZ9VQ9eHUpBO7c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Did scientists inadvertently caused the AIDS epidemic?","title":"The Origins of AIDS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
