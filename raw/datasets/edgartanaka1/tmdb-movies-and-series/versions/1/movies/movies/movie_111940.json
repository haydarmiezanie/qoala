His outstanding creations such as the Dutch Embassy in Berlin, the Seattle Library, the Casa da Musica concert hall in Porto, and the Guggenheim Heritage Museum in Las Vegas are working examples of the Dutchman's visionary theories about architecture and urban society.  \"Rem Koolhaas: A Kind of Architect\" is an engaging portrait of a visionary man, which takes us to the heart of his ideas.  The filmmakers have made a visually inventive thought provoking portrait of the architect, prompting Rem Koolhaas to state \"it's the only film about me that I have liked.\"","popularity":1.213,"poster_path":"/hddUdMnQxwk5vS01zaeTAVzrlQP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rem Koolhaas: A Kind of Architect","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
