All mental hospitals must cut their patient load by 1/5. LaRue (Will Keenan) is sent out onto the streets with a chronic reading disorder, and sent to the Love Hotel (where most of the inmate are being held). There he falls in love with a mute girl, who's obsessive mother dominates her life. To top this off, LaRue is given a roommate with turrets syndrome, and is chased by a prehistoric worm that inhabits peoples bodies and mutates them. This film is, to say the least, a crazy piece of work. Brilliant cinema, and creative genius at its best. The film's story is original, and dazzling. The FX, though budgeted, are impressive and effective. And the acting and scripting of the film is seamless.","popularity":3.97,"poster_path":"/vXV9BkTwBUyW5y54nBCKGtV3GbI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love God","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":7}
