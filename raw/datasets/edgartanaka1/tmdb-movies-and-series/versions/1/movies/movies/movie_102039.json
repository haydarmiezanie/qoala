Pulp-serial snippets, industrial-film imagery, and B- (and Z-) fiction clips are intercut with newly shot live-action material, powering a playful, allegorical trajectory through the now-mythic occult matrix of Jack Parsons (Crowleyite founder of the Jet Propulsion Lab), L.Ron Hubbard (sci-fi author turned cult-leader), and Marjorie Cameron (bohemian artist and \"mother of the New Age movement\"). Their intertwined tales spin out into a speculative farce on the militarization of space, and the corporate take-over of spiritual fulfillment and leisure-time.","popularity":2.139,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mock Up on Mu","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7}
