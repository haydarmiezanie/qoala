Or so says Annabelle, the hottest, the sexiest, and by far the craziest psycho blonde chick to hit Japan since WWII. Deeply embittered about the whole man's-inhumanity-to-man thing, she enacts a diabolical plot to unleash a swarm of mutant insects on the world that will destroy all living creatures except creepy crawlers.  Ensnared in all this madness is a philandering island-hopping bug collector and his compliant and slightly pregnant wife, a humorless doctor from the mainland, and a United States airman named Charlie, whose way of starting a conversation is to hysterically scream \"Genocide!\" and then go off his rocker like the dedicated military professional he is.  If you want to watch a story where everybody gets their nuclear holocaust on in the grand tradition of radioactive Japanese monster movies, this is the film for you!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinematic Titanic: War of the Insects","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
