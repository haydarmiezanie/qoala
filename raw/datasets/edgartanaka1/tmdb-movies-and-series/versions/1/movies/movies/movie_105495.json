For the better part of three decades, The Prince of Wales has worked side by side with a surprising and dynamic array of environmental activists, business leaders, artists, architects and government leaders. They are working to transform the world, address the global environmental crisis and find ways toward a more sustainable, spiritual and harmonious relationship with the planet.  From organic farms, to the rainforests of British Columbia, to rare footage of HRH interviewing Al Gore about climate change in 1988 - Harmony introduces viewers to a new and inspiring perspective on how the world can meet the challenges of climate change globally, locally and personally.","popularity":1.345,"poster_path":"/65xccV9az2KNNf4Uc0GMZhXNyJI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":null,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harmony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
