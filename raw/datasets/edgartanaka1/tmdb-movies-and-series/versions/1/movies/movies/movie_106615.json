He played for the Calgary Flames, New York Rangers and Chicago Blackhawks. He made 50 million dollars and threw it away on drugs, alcohol and gambling. He reached bottom, and bought a gun intending to kill himself. At the last minute he changed his mind. He wrote a book revealing that, as a teen, he'd been sexually abused by his coach. It created a firestorm of publicity and went on to become a No. 1 bestseller in Canada. Theo starred in a top-rated skating competition reality show and had a cameo in the opening film at TIFF last year. Inspired by the book, the documentary follows Theo's struggle with the aftermath of the book and gives his turmoil a voice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theo Fleury: Playing With Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
