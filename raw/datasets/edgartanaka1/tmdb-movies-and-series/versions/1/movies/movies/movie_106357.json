Massimo is also involved with drugs and he sometimes steals to make a living and support his habit (the theft of a tobacco box is very important to the story). Among his associates are his girlfriend, Cinzia, who comes from a wealthy family, and he has a wealthy male friend named Rudy who is very naive as well as strangely pampered by his overly-doting mother. Both families don't approve of their relationship with Massimo.","popularity":1.02,"poster_path":"/8KbHK46Jo0FZ3CDsEfbIU6X6XRK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108956,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diapason Cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1975-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hallucination Strip","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
