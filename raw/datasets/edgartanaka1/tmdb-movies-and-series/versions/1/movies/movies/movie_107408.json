Forced to clear his own name, the handsome journalist sinks deeper into the Black Line’s rotten swamp of drugs, prostitution, and murder and finds unexpected help in Maya, a steamy female gambler familiar with the neon-lit streets, shadowy alleyways, and seedy nightclubs he must navigate.  The closest film in the Line series to classic American film noir, Ishii’s Black Line is a pulpy assortment of crime film conventions including the starkly expressionistic black and white cinematography by Jûgyô Yoshida, a jazzy music score by Michiaki Watanabe, and a sleazy screenplay by Ishii and Ichirô Miyagawa.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3094,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shintoho Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1960-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Line","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
