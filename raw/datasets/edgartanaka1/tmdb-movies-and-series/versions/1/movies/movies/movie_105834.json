A circus dwarf who is in love with one of these creatures leads them to a mansion filled with oddly behaving nuns, The Order of the White Virgins. The nuns are detaining a beautiful woman who is the betrothed of the still-extant Dracula. When she escapes, everyone follows her to Dracula's seaside castle, on the way dealing with a baby-eating ogress and a wolf-woman (Brigitte Lahaie in a cameo), witches and madwomen. The bizarre wedding ritual commences.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/yy8ZY9LK5iIweQ3YAuuyqJyPY4a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fiancée of Dracula","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6}
