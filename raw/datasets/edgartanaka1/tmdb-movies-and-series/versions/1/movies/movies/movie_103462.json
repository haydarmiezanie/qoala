This modern Icelandic fairy tale is one of the most beautiful stories to be told about music. In seven years, Grandma Lo-Fi recorded 59 records and wrote more than 600 songs. The creative senior is a cult figure of the Icelandic music scene and thus it seems obvious to go through Grandma Lo-Fi’s life accompanied by artists such as Múm, Sin Fang and Mr Silla.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2011-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Basement Tapes of Sigrídur Níelsdóttir","title":"Grandma Lo-Fi","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
