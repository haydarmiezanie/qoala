The film also tackles the question of its location within the female genitalia. Sparked by a study written by Andrea Burri (King’s College, London) in which she denounces the physical existence of a G-spot, narrator Ségolène Hanotaux sets out to interview numerous authors, citizens, subject experts, geneticists, and therapists about the subject matter thus sparking a renewed interest in this debatable arena.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story of Pleasure and Promise","title":"G-Spotting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
