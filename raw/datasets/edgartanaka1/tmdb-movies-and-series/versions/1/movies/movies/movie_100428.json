The language has given her magical powers, enabling her to ward-off the frenzied attention of her adoring fans, and the British Library offers an ideal refuge from the hordes. But when she meets Adam, the one Sun-reader in the country she hadn't bargained for, Keeley is given a lesson in not judging books by their covers. Her journey of discovery will reveal just how far she's come to rely on the advantages of fame. A warped retelling of Ovid's most famous myth, Venus and Adonis, and a comic study of society's obsession with the image.","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Being a goddess can be such a boar","title":"Venus & the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
