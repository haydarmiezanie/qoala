He also learns that in order to reestablish a livable atmosphere for what's left of humanity, he'll have to go on a solitary mission to retrieve important codes dispersed in remote locations. Soon enough, he'll encounter more than he bargained for: aliens, crazy survivors, inadequate equipment, LOTS of walking and a pretty unhealthy dose of bad luck.","popularity":3.675,"poster_path":"/ZpN5TIpwKaOVYty4TOBnrli6VQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"REBORN TO LOSE.","title":"Hellacious Acres: The Case of John Glass","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":5}
