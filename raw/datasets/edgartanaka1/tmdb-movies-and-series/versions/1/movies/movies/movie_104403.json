Central character is a female wrestler who has decided that she no longer wants to wrestle, but whose mother (a former wrestler herself) wants her to keep wrestling to make money so her brother can have the operation (his seminal vessels run to his skull, rather than his groin, which purportedly will cause his head to explode if he gets too excited). During the course of her story (in which a number of brawls ensue), she is befriended by a Elvis-impersonating martial artist.  This recut/redubbed version is 72 minutes long.","popularity":1.894,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3052,"logo_path":null,"name":"Troma Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If Woody Allen's What's Up Tiger Lilly? made you laugh out loud, this one'll make you change your underpants.","title":"Ferocious Female Freedom Fighters","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":6}
