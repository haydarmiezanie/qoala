Such animals have no choice but to invade human habitats and become man-eaters. This story is inspired by one such attack. A couple vacationing in the Indian jungle are disturbed by the arrival of the wife's ex-lover, opening wounds that are best left unhealed; but their troubles have only begun. They are being hunted by a leopard that's turned man-eater and it will stop at nothing to satisfy its hunger.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Forest","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
