To help her, her roommate Chris decides to step in, and devises a plan. Chris follows Morrison on his trip to Sun Valley, Idaho and plays the overattentive female, hoping that he will send for Ellen (who often played his \"fianc√©e\" when he had a female he couldn't discourage otherwise.) Complications arise when Chris catches the eye of band leader Dick Layne, and finds herself caught in a triangle between the two men.","popularity":3.289,"poster_path":"/d2FgTBql8pWZkQlH0211ds9xkrI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/mjofSXiHpG5t6KYmU4l4FrUhT7m.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"M-G-M's TECHNICOLOR Musical of Sun Valley Splendor!","title":"Duchess of Idaho","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
