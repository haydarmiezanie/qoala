First off, their stepparents are despicably evil. Secondly, they seemed to have killed them. Now this mixed up mess of half-sisters and step-brothers have to figure out how to dispose of the bodies, cover up the murders, collect their grandfather's inheritance and somehow stick together as a family -- all without getting caught. Not to mention Joe's incessant need to keep tabs on his promiscuous sister, an eye on the precocious little ones and a lustful watch on the girl next-door. Growing up has its complications. Murder's just one of them.","popularity":3.198,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Step-Films Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":14185,"logo_path":"/bjwHArtlcoC9WvlT1vM66ad2ij2.png","name":"Canadian Film Centre (CFC)","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":21953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feature Film Project","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siblings","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7}
