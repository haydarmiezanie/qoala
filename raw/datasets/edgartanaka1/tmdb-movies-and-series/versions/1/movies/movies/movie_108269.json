A juggler takes in succession about a dozen eggs out of his servant's mouth. He breaks all the eggs into a hat, and after having beaten them up after the manner of a cook, he extracts an egg as large as the hat itself. As soon as he sets this egg on the table there appears a tiny dancing girl, full of life, as big as a baby's doll, and who performs on the table some beautiful stage dances. All of a sudden she increases to the size of a ordinary woman, and jumping on the floor she delights the audience with her turns. The juggler and the dancing girl disappear in the most extraordinary way.” (Méliès Catalog)","popularity":2.678,"poster_path":"/lC4Tib7qKpDnMmF35kEfLpgJ1X2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star-Film","origin_country":""},{"id":37046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georges Méliès","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1902-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marvellous Egg Production","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":8}
