He suspects Twig Dawson but can't prove it. Butch loves Don but he, poor fool, won't notice her as a woman; instead he meets socialite Celia in town and elopes with her. The action plot (Don's pursuit of the fire starter) parallels Tana's comic efforts to scare tenderfoot Celia back to the city.","popularity":0.848,"poster_path":"/zp81LtpWnentGY2JlEaC8vKvGzp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4,"logo_path":"/fycMZt242LVjagMByZOLUGbCvv3.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sizzling Adventure...Flaming Romance...Hot as a Forest Fire!","title":"The Forest Rangers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
