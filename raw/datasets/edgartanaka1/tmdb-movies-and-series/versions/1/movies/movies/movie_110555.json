His wife, meanwhile, struggles to pay the tuition and understand her husband’s lack of interest in the family’s survival—even as the bank repossesses their furniture. But when a group of policemen blackmails Checkie into entrapping the son of his wealthy friend, husband and wife are unified by the uncertainty of their deepening moral dilemma, and a series of worsening foul-ups, in Levan Koguashvili’s lightly humorous yet realistic drama about the fate of a generation left behind in Georgia’s post-Soviet era.","popularity":2.507,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Street Days","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7}
