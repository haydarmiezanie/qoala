He encounters Alex, the star host of the Breakfast Club, a popular morning radio show. With Cyril, a forty-something who'd prefer not to be, and Arnold, the charismatic leader of the gang, they call the shots on Blast FM. In next to no time Ben is hired to write for them. He's barely joined the team when a tidal wave hits the station: Breakfast Club listenership is in free fall. They set out on a bus to travel to every corner of France to meet and win over their public once again. For these arrogant Parisians, a real journey of initiation arises from this radio-phonic road trip, shaking up all their certainties.","popularity":6.301,"poster_path":"/fDWaRlIpUOHriMHaiKleFpYFzRE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2612,"logo_path":"/3ulBLchjjnjVmvyLQSwO62MDKLE.png","name":"Les Productions du Trésor","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radiostars","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":138}
