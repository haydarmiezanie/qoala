She defied tradition in an extraordinary career that spanned several decades. The first journalist to enter the Soviet Arctic in 1935, Ruth also traveled to Alaska as a member of the Roosevelt administration in 1942, escorted Holocaust refugees to America in 1944, covered the Nuremberg trials in 1946, and documented the Haganah ship 'Exodus' in 1947. Her relationships with world leaders gave her unique access and insight. This documentary interweaves verite scenes with archival footage.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/thov4rXt8p3w3MLQbxBfhIrJE25.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reel Inheritance Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ruth Gruber didn't just report the news...she made it!","title":"Ahead of Time: The Extraordinary Journey of Ruth Gruber","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
