Margie insists on taking pictures of everywhere they go, and so as she's walking into a butcher shop she poses for Dan - while at the same time three thugs make their way quickly out after beating up the proprietors.  Soon Margie and Dan are involved in investigating an illegal meat operation that rustles cattle and forces butchers to buy it - or else.  Dan gets beaten up a couple of times, but is undaunted in pursuing the great story - and hey, he's only got 64 minutes to do so, he'd best get cracking!","popularity":1.213,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52361,"logo_path":null,"name":"Donald Barry Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":4222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Screen Guild Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Action-Packed Expose of Cattle Rustling Today","title":"Tough Assignment","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
