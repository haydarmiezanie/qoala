The four suspects are Ankit Sharma, his school-going brother, Dhruv; Rohan Goverdhan Malhotra, and Bulai. The suspects ridicule them and mockingly ask the guards to let them go. A check of their belongings, including a video camera, shows pictures of prominent places, prompting Om Prakash to summon Vijay D. Chauhan, from the Anti-Terrorist Squad. The latter shows up, is initially skeptical, but after he overhears a rather incriminating conversation between Ankit and a woman named Prachi, is convinced that the four may be terrorists and interrogates them. The four steadfastly deny their involvement in any terrorist activity - but must face up to the situation when a fifth suspect, a woman named Diana, claims that they belong to her group - which has already made plans to blow up the airport today.","popularity":1.104,"poster_path":"/pE0SFeO09BuSFI9YpRHxU8tx1Wu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2011-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shakal Pe Mat Ja","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
