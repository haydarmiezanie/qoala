Most songs are taken from 2006's Standing in the Way of Control, the band's feverish, disco-blues boogie down. Singer Beth Ditto does a less raspy Janis Joplin as she belts out sweat-inducing renditions of \"Yr Mangled Heart,\" \"Fire with Fire\" and \"Standing in the Way of Control.\" Fans will also appreciate stripped-down covers of Aaliyah's \"Are You That Somebody\" and Wham!'s \"Careless Whisper.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gossip : Standing In The Way Of Control (Live in Liverpool)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
