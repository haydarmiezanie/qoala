While aboard, they have a brief run-in with (a secret German Nazi officer) Lt. Dungen (Vernon Dent), and then mistake a torpedo for a beached whale. Moe says they have to kill it, and it promptly explodes. After being lost at sea for several days, they come across the SS Schicklgruber and climb aboard. Now with fully grown beards, they come across Lt. Dungen again, who does not recognize them. After realizing they are in with a nest of German sailors, they eventually overtake the crew and toss them overboard.","popularity":3.115,"poster_path":"/6Qgn4TEQyI0e7xxhTZ0LlmBFIGN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Any resemblance between the characters in this picture and other human beings is a dirty shame.","title":"Back from the Front","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":6}
