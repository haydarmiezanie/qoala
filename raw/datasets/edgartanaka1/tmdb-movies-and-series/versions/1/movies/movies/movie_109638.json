His girlfriend adores him, his best mate David is loyal to the end, plus David’s girlfriend doesn’t mind a quick hook-up either.  But Michael’s self-regarding lifestyle comes crashing down when he is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Desperate not to let his life just fade away, Michael steals the $200,000 raised for his treatment, and catches a one-way flight to London.  He isn’t there for long before his nerve and sense of humour earn him a vicious beating in a back alley. Waking up cold and bloodied, he finds himself being watched over by the ethereal Sylvie; a mysterious French drifter. They fall head over heels in love, and attempt to outrun death itself.","popularity":1.255,"poster_path":"/5Fr0bi3OAtbQ14fiBCgoOBb7n6x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live Life.
