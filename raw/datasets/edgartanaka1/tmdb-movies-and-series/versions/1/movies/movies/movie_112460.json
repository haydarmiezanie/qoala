As Mathers notices that the family is tearing apart and that his wife's behavior becomes more violent and erratic, he accepts that to save the woman he married he must take a leap of faith.  London Voodoo is one of the few films about voodoo to show the belief system in a positive light. Here, it's \"work\" that's evil. The film shows multicultural voodoo followers in a contemporary urban setting (London). As research for the script, the filmmakers travelled to Cuba, Miami and New Orleans to experience voodoo first hand.","popularity":3.71,"poster_path":"/qqOB0PStiebd1DQh3SxUztU12Bu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22057,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zen Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2004-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London Voodoo","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":3}
