Criterion presents a sampling of her stunning craft, all collaborations with television arts-programming pioneer Nathan Kroll. A Dancerâ€™s World (1957), narrated by Graham herself, is a glimpse into her class work and methodology. Appalachian Spring (1958) and Night Journey (1961) are two complete Graham ballets, the first a celebration of the American pioneer spirit, scored by Aaron Copland, the second a powerfully physical rendering of the Oedipus myth. These are signature Graham works and tributes to the art of the human body.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/jGhxyv2t3uUcSq80N3sYqtsi2gH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Martha Graham: Dance on Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
