He buys a Peugeot station wagon - license plate GFP831E, and the family sets off for annual holidays exploring every corner of Europe - \"adopting local customs but never forgetting who won the war.\" The narrator is one of the children who, as he ages, sees things he missed as a lad - the car no rocket, dad no speedster. As the years wear on, and the car sits in the driveway, dad keeps it ready for the next great summer holiday.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home Road Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
