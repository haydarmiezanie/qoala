But, to his surprise, he learns his brilliant idea's not exactly original; there are other residents who dodge the night watchmen, and who keep their existence secret at all costs. And one of them is a young woman who wants to leave, but is too frightened to go. And Charles finds that he wants to show her the larger world outside.","popularity":1.162,"poster_path":"/aU1Wof6rL7M3XVvMthGlEpUVWXv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Francis Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":19366,"logo_path":"/vOH8dyQhLK01pg5fYkgiS31jlFm.png","name":"ABC Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If you can find me, I'm here","title":"Evening Primrose","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":3}
