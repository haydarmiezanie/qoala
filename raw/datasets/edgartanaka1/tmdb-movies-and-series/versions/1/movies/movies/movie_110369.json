The film is a rather straightforward and faithful adaptation of a novel by Maria Dabrowska with the same title. The plot is woven around the changing fortunes of a noble (upper-class) Niechcic family in the pre-WWI Poland. There are two main crossing threads: a social history one and an existential one. The cinematographic version is a condensation of the 12 part award winning TV serial of the same title and using the same cast and producers.","popularity":2.925,"poster_path":"/tSBIiO3uuoJSRBQVEPBGLHQXQZw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespół Filmowy \"Kadr\"","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1975-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":277,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nights and Days","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":6}
