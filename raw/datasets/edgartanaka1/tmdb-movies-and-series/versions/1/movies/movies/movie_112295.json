(So, what's your price?), it seems to be the constant over this excellent documentary work, performed by Olallo Rubio, a young Mexican director. The movie shows two faces of the same issue: the American influence in the Mexican culture. you will remain thinking after the movie ends. Everything has a price? Everybody has a price?, so, What's your price?. Strong and ancient differences between two distant-neighbor countries are discussed under each opinion. Both Mexican and American-common persons give its particular point of view about the other, but also about themselves. Developed with a extremely low budget, but with inventive and imagination, this movie shows many of the key aspects in the Mexican-American relationship. However, the movie is not just a compilation of statistics, the producers manage to make it fun too. That's one of it's good points. But never the only one. Well developed, absolutely recommendable.","popularity":1.171,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2007-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary","title":"So, What's Your Price?","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":8}
