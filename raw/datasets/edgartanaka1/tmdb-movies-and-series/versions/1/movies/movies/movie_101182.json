That leads to some heavy expectations, which fortunately aren't disappointed, at least if you aren't expecting the customary over-the-top performances Vaughan was famous for. His playing here is much more laid-back and controlled, which is actually a recommendation--the stylistic similarities between teacher and student are that much more pronounced. The songs are mostly King concert staples, with the exception of \"Pride and Joy\"; highlights include the T-Bone Walker classic \"Call It Stormy Monday\" and one of King's own, \"Overall Junction,\" which features some excellent guitar solo work. The snippets of recorded conversation between songs are interesting curiosities as well. --Genevieve Williams","popularity":3.441,"poster_path":"/aeqdcmDUwrMibQbtAR3C5z0mzd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albert King with Stevie Ray Vaughan: In Session","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
