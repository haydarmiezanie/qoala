One of the aliens steals into a cave beneath a temple where the hapless but lovable Magic Lizard appears to be responsible for guarding some kind of treasure. After threatening Magic Lizard with a light saber, the alien makes off with a crystal of some sort, after which Magic Lizard starts with the high-pitched nattering and spazzing out that will characterize his behavior for the rest of the film. He runs to Yuk Wud Jaeng, the demon-like living statue previously featured in both Giant and Jumbo A and Tah Tien and pleads for his help. Yuk Wud Jaeng takes off into the heavens, not to be seen again for some time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8kC8ZXi8utk42wEyKaMAA3nowU5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chaiyo Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magic Lizard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
