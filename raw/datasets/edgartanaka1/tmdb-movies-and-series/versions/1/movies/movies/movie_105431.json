His family -middle class with bad luck - silently suffers the pressure of the other part of the family- middle class with good luck and best influences. The desire of the car and the hope to get it encourage his parents to take the child, piggy bank in hand, through a strange journey to the colorful and surprisingly familiar world full of lies and blackmail.

And that way, Pablito will create his own happy ending.","popularity":1.213,"poster_path":"/9iG7xzqrSxGYKytTtClr68hhKxD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"eo","name":"Esperanto"},{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pedal Push Car","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
