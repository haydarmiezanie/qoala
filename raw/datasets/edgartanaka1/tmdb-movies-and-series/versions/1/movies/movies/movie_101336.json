Strong dedicated most of his 2010 season trying to perfect the front flip, and after many scary mishaps he finally looked to have it dialed towards the end of the Australia Crusty Demons tour, where he rode away from it in Sydney for only the second time on tour.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleshwound Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crusty Demons 15: Blood Sweat & Fears","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
