In 1958, the body of Eva Szalanczky, a political journalist, is discovered near the border. Her friend Livia is in hospital with a broken neck; Livia's husband, Donci, is under arrest. In a flashback to the year before, we see what leads up to the tragedy. Eva gets a job as a writer. She meets Livia and is attracted to her. Livia feels much the same, but as a married woman, has doubts and hesitations. In their work, they (and Eva in particular) bang up against the limits of telling political truths; in private, they confront the limits of living out sexual and emotional truth.","popularity":4.498,"poster_path":"/fAcY6F8pCf91tgLdLxQFIhLnnI9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Meridian Films","origin_country":""},{"id":9088,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAFILM Dialóg Filmstúdió","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1982-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Way","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":7}
