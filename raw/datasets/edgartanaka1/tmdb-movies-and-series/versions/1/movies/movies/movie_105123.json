It follows the short life of early Australian aviator, Cliff Carpenter, using his narrative as a template to speak for all lives senselessly lost in wartime conflict. The documentary climaxes in the skies over Oslo, Norway as two Messerschmitt Bf110's attack a RAF Sunderland Flying Boat. Nine airmen perish and one miraculously survives. The story is told through the eyes of Bill Young, the nephew Cliff would never know.","popularity":1.358,"poster_path":"/m3m0puQcMZIRsAEkqh1LQp2pjaU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Very Short War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
