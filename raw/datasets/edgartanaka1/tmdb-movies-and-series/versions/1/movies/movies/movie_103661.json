A committed tech-geek, she fears she is more interested in ultrasound technology than in what's being ultra-sounded.  When her sister lures her to L.A. for what ends up being a terrorizing baby shower, Sarah keeps her rental van and hits the road in search of the source of her anxiety: her estranged mother, now living off the grid.  Small, Beautifully Moving Parts takes a comical, yet poignant look at one woman's coming-of-parenthood in the age of technology.","popularity":0.939,"poster_path":"/3piu9TCjELbycMPKvCKrl4xETxj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small, Beautifully Moving Parts","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
