Roy is a traditional and orthodox gentleman, who is unable to understand nor appreciate the carelessness of today's youth. He has brought up his daughter, Shobha, with these same traditions, and he hopes to get her married in a good household. To his shock and dismay, Shobha is in love with Ramesh Saxena, an unemployed youth, who has no respect for tradition. Justice Roy is opposed to any alliance with Ramesh in any way whatsoever, until and unless Ramesh gets a suitable and respectable job, and learns to respect tradition. Ramesh does get a job with a textile mill, and gets a bonus payment, which is to be presented to him in an open ceremony, presided over by Justice Roy. When the bonus payment is being handed over to Ramesh, a woman comes forward and claims that Ramesh is her husband, who had abandoned her soon after their marriage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ulta Seedha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
