Furthermore, we just used original instruments from that time (amongst other things, Revox tape recorder, Commodore C-64, Atari ST – functional reliability was not guaranteed!). The whole program was exclusively rehearsed for this event: Many of the songs were performed live for the first and only time, the other compositions were presented in special ‘retro’ versions.” The concert was autonomously organized, privately planned, financed and accomplished by Deine Lakaien in collaboration with the fan club and several long-time companions of the band.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deine Lakaien - The Concert That Never Happened Before","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
