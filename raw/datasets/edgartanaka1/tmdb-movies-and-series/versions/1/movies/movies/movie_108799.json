These nurses are obvious lesbians. Victor lives with Eliza and her son. He imagines another woman when he is roaming at a coast. He pretends committing a suicide but Eliza does not react to it. Every moment, he stays in front of a blank canvas and thinks. Meanwhile he dresses into Nazi clothes or into women dresses, then he leaves to go to the cinema, and abuses and probably kills a small girl. His masochistic affair with Eliza lasts; he is close to shooting her with a gun but instead she takes out a whip. Victor goes along the streets then he lies naked in front of the canvas on which he has left his bloody fingerprints. After this he drives a funeral car to his work - he is employed in a garden where orchids are grown. Eliza is now the past and in the end, Victor might be dead as someone drives a cross into the ground.","popularity":1.897,"poster_path":"/89XGw3B037hgHBovQxTNqP8tHX8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Orchid Gardener","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
