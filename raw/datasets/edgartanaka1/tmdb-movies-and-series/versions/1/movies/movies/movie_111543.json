It stars Nakul, Sunaina, Pavan, Santhanam, Srinath, Karunas, M. S. Baskar, Delhi Ganesh, and others. The film is a tribute to yesteryear movies, as it follows an old kind of plot.  Masi (Nakul) is an orphan living in a lower middle class colony. With a heart of gold, he is a popular guy who takes up local issues, fights for them and is considered as a rowdy by those who don’t know him.  Bhoopathy (Pawan), the local corrupt Sub Inspector who is also behind Divya, is determined to flop the hero’s plans and seeks to uncover his disguise of Mani. He is always on look out to prove that Mani is none other than Masi, the rowdy. How Mani wins over Divya against all odds serves as the climax of the movie.","popularity":1.668,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5907,"logo_path":"/u2MPw19ZZ4mIzacy6SXOLgU1la0.png","name":"AGS Entertainment","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2009-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maasilamani","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":3}
