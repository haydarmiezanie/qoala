As a child Hanuman mischievously tried to swallow the sun, thinking it was a fruit. When he is smote for his unwitting trespass by Indra, king of the Gods, he lays lifeless, only to be resurrected and granted gifts by an assemblage of gods. These gifts along with his own virtues earn him the title of Mahabali, or The Mighty One. His life is the subject of this film, which focuses on both his childhood exploits and adult adventures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahabali Hanuman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
