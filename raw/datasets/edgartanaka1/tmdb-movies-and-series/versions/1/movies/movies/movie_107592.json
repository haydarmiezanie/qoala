All Jane and Ralph want is a small wedding with the immediate family and no reception. This is because Jane's parents are poor and Jane and Ralph can borrow a car for their honeymoon. However, at dinner that night all Ralph's parents talk about are the big weddings they gave their daughters and everything escalates. All of a sudden, it is a big wedding breakfast with hundreds of guests. The problem is that for 12 years, Tom has been saving money to buy his own cab and license, but now that he can, all of his money is going towards a wedding neither he, or Jane or Ralph really want.","popularity":3.205,"poster_path":"/hfRcP2beAtOSHUNnB9vCbezZFHJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/mjofSXiHpG5t6KYmU4l4FrUhT7m.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you're in love, nothing else matters","title":"The Catered Affair","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":18}
