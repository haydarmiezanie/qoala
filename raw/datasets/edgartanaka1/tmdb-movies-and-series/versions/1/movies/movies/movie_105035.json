He finds a country ruined by grinding poverty, famine, war, disease and appalling social inequality. At the same time, he meets a joyful, brave people hungry for happiness, knowledge and human dignity. The camera that becomes his personal diary also helps Jean-Marc expose the shaky, ineffective workings of NGOs. His investigations turn up a few praiseworthy examples of international cooperation, but on the whole he finds himself drawn to a terrible, inescapable conclusion: humanitarian aid is a utopian mirage. After falling victim to an attack and losing whatever ideals he still had, Jean-Marc becomes entangled in an impossible relationship. He is ultimately forced to leave Africa in disgrace.","popularity":1.511,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":20181,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coop Vidéo de Montréal","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BI","name":"Burundi"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Diary of a Volunteer","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
