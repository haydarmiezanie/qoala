But who's protecting the juvenile delinquents from corrupt reform schools? Rica could be considered a bit of an expert on reform schools, having spent most of her early life in and out of them. When Rica is dragged back once again, she gets a severe beating and is finally sent off to a mental hospital with the intention of selling her and her pals into a slave trade. A trader takes Rica's friend Jun to a mountain cottage where she's pegged for the lead in his clandestine porno film operation. Once again, it's up to tough-as-nails Rica to bust up this corrupt racket once and for all!","popularity":1.479,"poster_path":"/v619IGOqU3b6hM51NGknHR0YGtL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1516,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kindai Eiga Kyokai","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1973-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No life could have had more hate, more violence, less love!","title":"Rica 3: Juvenile's Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
