Taking its title (as a reference or homage) from Alain Resnais’ pivotal 1956 documentary Nuit et Brouillard, the film has a group of former student revolutionaries who meet again years later at the wedding of one of their classmates. Old feelings, rivalries and grudges gradually erupt to the surface as the one-time friends recall the various treacheries by which their cause was defeated. Cutting between times past and the present, and unfolding the action from each of his characters viewpoints, Oshima creates an abstract and yet engrossing study of passions past and principles eroded. —Yume Pictures","popularity":1.473,"poster_path":"/vowvOXtKIsJ405w60aOj9ArEhAN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1960-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Arthouse","title":"Night and Fog in Japan","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
