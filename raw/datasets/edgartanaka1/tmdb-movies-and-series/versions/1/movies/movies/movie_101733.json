Things start to go badly when Maki finds a parasitical worm inside a fish they catch – and wolfs it down alive, in the hope that it’ll help keep her skinny! Soon after, and not so unexpectedly in situations like this, zombies show up and begin to complicate things further. After they’re attached by a crowd of poop-covered undead who emerge from an outhouse toilet, the group seeks refuge at the home of strange Dr. Tanaka and his daughter Sachi. But unbeknownst to them, Tanaka has been conducting experiments on the parasites—and the zombies!—and has another fate in mind for the five strangers from the city.","popularity":6.55,"poster_path":"/sKJ1uRFB8eFUD40uVOqGl9MXAoY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":955,"logo_path":"/5xnXD3PJI1HqOJceSAKZ3fDqO1V.png","name":"Nikkatsu Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They Come in the Toilet","title":"Zombie Ass: Toilet of the Dead","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":37}
