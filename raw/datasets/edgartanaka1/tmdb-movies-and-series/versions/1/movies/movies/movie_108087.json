Striking a welcome retro note in its languid pacing and delicate handling of seriocomic ensemble threads, handsome production is a natural for fests. It might also prove a cornerstone for retrospectives or ancillary releases of works by a helmer (\"Preparation of the Festival,\" \"Ronin-gai\") who's long been appreciated at home but has won just limited attention abroad.","popularity":1.271,"poster_path":"/eOsUSayYsVCLnfIXA9ow9Qwpk6K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11861,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rumble Fish","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2002-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Boy's Summer in 1945","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
