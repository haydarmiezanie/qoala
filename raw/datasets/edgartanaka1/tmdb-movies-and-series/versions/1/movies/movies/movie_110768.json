The hand is weathered, the fingers cracked and scarred. The end of a rifle appears and a shot fires. The bullet is visible whirling through space; it caroms and then goes through a pine cone. A long spoon emerges from a drawer in the chair and stretches toward the hand. The bullet is on the spoon. Later, the hand holds the bullet between two fingers; another shot is fired.","popularity":1.787,"poster_path":"/4m1nI4l3LP08cFD9r5u1xvRZ920.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16734,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atelier Koninck","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stille Nacht III: Tales from the Vienna Woods","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
