This documentary tells their extraordinary, moving story, begining with the mass call-up of horses from every farm and country estate in the land. Racing commentator Brough Scott tells the tale of his aristocratic grandfather General Jack Seely and his beloved horse Warrior, who would become the most famous horse of the war. The British Army hoped its illustrious cavalry regiments would win a swift victory, but it would be years before they enjoyed their moment of glory. Instead, in a new era of mechanised trench warfare, the heavy horses transporting guns, ammunition and food to the front-line troops were most important. A quarter of a million of these horses died from shrapnel wounds and disease. But the deep bond that developed between man and horse helped both survive the hell of the Somme and Passchendaele.","popularity":1.327,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84783,"logo_path":"/FgUZnTXfLk2X4AN3QXisg7lAhb.png","name":"Testimony Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2012-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War Horse The Real Story","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":5}
