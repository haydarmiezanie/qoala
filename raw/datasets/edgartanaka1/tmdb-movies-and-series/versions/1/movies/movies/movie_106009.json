To their neighbors, they we're the perfect family. Nothing was further from the truth. Mary, their paranoid schizophrenic mother, was medicating herself with narcotics, but the doctors preferred shock treatments. Their father tried to keep it secret, though the strain was more than he could bear. Years later, Call developed paranoid schizophrenia and walked out on his life. Overwhelmed by voices in his head, he wandered the country, drifting in and out of sanity. Amazingly, after twenty years of searching, Rebecca found Call alive, but not well... A Sister's Call chronicles Rebecca's mission to bring her brother back from the depths of homelessness and schizophrenia all while seeking a way to heal herself from the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some call him crazy.
