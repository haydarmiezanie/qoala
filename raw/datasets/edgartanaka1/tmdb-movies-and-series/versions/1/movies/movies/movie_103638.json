Coming from humble origins, she always felt slighted by her mother's preference for her sister. She grew up in an unhappy environment, until her career in the operatic world took off. Aristotles Onassis also came from a poor Greek family. His ambition took him places where others dare not go and became a shipping magnate whose great wealth bought his entry into an international society he didn't ever dreamed of entering.  These two powerful personalities were so much alike that their own passion served to destroy them.","popularity":0.971,"poster_path":"/xokYvkAAhj2P8CpU8Jvpot3QaMD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2005-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Callas & Onassis","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":5}
