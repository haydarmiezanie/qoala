Motif that binds all of the stories together is the tenth anniversary of the democratic revolution. Each film is taking place on that day, 5th of October in 2010, and each film is differently related to the anniversary and what that event means 10 years after. The film brings fresh visions of the seven young directors who were teenagers at the time of the overthrow of president Milosevic and his regime. On a personal and emotional way they show a complex picture of modern Serbia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":62357,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vision Team","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":63904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fakultet Dramskih Umetnosti (FDU)","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2011-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"October","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
