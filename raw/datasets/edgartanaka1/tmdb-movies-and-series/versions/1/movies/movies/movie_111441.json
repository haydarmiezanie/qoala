Relatively unknown due to poor distribution and New York Film Festival skullduggery, this breathtaking film presents a unique epic vision with quasi-dramatic elements and cinematographic wizardry. The non-reggae original soundtrack is outstanding, as is the reggae music of Bob Marley and Gregory Isaacs. The great documentary filmmaker Werner Herzog has called \"Look Behind\" the non-fiction film that has influenced him most over the last fifteen years. Indeed, this film's peers are the best of Herzog, Bunuel's \"Land Without Bread\", Flaherty's \"Nanook\" and Leacock-Pennebaker's \"Louisiana Story\". With thoughtful viewing, one will see this moving documentary actually end with a lovely little dream sequence. No American has come close to making a film this ingenious in the last thirty years.","popularity":1.383,"poster_path":"/3K6GRqrpjZPIfnwbap4uHVmvU98.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film by Alan Greenberg","title":"Land of Look Behind","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":5}
