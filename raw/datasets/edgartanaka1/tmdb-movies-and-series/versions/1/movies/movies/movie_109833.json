Expatriate Kiwi sexologist Dr John Money of the world renowned Johns Hopkins Medical School believed that gender was the product of “nurture not nature.” His studies into intersex people led to a particular surgical treatment model for babies born with ambiguous genitalia – the idea being that doctors could produce healthy and happy men and women by intervening early in an intersex child’s life. Usually that meant a family secret that had to be kept at all costs.  But as the film shows, human sexual development is never that straight forward. This is a heart-warming story told with a mix of laughter and tears in the most frank and revealing way.","popularity":0.882,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The first question any new parent asks… “Is it a boy or a girl?”","title":"Intersexion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
