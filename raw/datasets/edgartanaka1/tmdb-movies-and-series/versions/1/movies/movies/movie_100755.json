A lethal injection of both concert and studio documentation, this DVD is testament to the maxim \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,\" the veritable life code of one Aleister Crowley, who, in his time, was widely regarded as the most dangerous man in the world. Whether Cradle of Filth even come close to the prestigious title of \"the most dangerous band in the world\" remains as yet to be seen, but if there's one thing watching this marriage of Heaven, Hell, and the worst bits in between will assure you of, it's the Filth's ability to shock, shake, and deliver where it hurts the most... right on your grave.  Open up and say.... \"Aaarrrggh!\"","popularity":3.519,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cradle Of Filth: Heavy Left-Handed & Candid","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
