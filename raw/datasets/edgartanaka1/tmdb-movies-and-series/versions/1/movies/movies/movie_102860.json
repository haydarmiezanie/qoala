Madalena is responsible for baking bread; each morning she stacks her rolls as Antonio prepares the coffee. The two share a morning ritual of arguments and insults, followed by an amicable cup of coffee on the bench outside Antonio's shop. At midday the church bells ring, summoning the villagers to mass. In the early evening, they all share a meal together. And so life proceeds in Jotuomba, the days languidly drifting into one another; the only variations seem to be in the weather. But, one day Rita arrives looking for a place to stay.","popularity":0.924,"poster_path":"/fERzBTJAft18aTi7Qm6Ui7MZTw7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53812,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taiga Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":51399,"logo_path":null,"name":"MPM Film","origin_country":""},{"id":77176,"logo_path":null,"name":"CEPA Audiovisual","origin_country":""},{"id":93204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bonfilm","origin_country":""},{"id":11547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ancine","origin_country":""},{"id":65091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Programa Ibermedia","origin_country":""},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"Centre national du cinéma et de l'image animée","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2011-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Found Memories","video":false,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":7}
