One of them, as he is dying, asks Jiang to take his personal effects to his sister.  This being a Wuxia film, our hero is bound by a strict code of honour, and he agrees.  The bandit’s sister, Xiu Xiu (Shu Pei-Pei), is surprisingly forgiving and tells him that he got mixed up in a bad crowd of robbers before he died.  As it happens, these self-same bandits are threatening to tear up the village at any moment, and Jiang prepares to defend it despite being despised by the town folk for killing Xiu Xiu’s brother.","popularity":1.426,"poster_path":"/zKvaD6mxQMSUG0Bh3PELhrO5Umt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw Brothers","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1968-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magnificent Swordsman","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":6}
