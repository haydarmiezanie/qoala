He's even got a very Battish theme songâ€¦. The somewhat convoluted plot concerns two gang of thieves who rob the same bank. One is a band of babes headed by a ruthless woman; the other is a group of thugs lead by a guy who has a serum that can turn anyone invisible. The employee they rob is none other than Flashman in disguise.","popularity":1.111,"poster_path":"/1TEYOa2v075XYSGZyK6Ld673i9j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zenith Cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1967-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Batman in red tights","title":"Flashman","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":5}
