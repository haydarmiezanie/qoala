This breakthrough album generated worldwide sales of six million with smash singles including Iris, Black Balloon and the webmaster's favorite Slide. Enter MTV with an original television concept called \"Music in High Places.\" Musicians are brought to remote and scenic locations with a camera and recording crew where they perform their songs outdoors and interact with the locals.  In July of 2002, the Goo Goo Dolls were flown to Alaska where they visited several towns and performed their songs. Some of the environmental sounds actually can be heard on the recording such as water flowing around the glacier ice. The program also includes interviews with the band as well as video footage of them having fun with the town's residents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4vSOFYdhuf2X2AM5Vf87AsYLv6P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goo Goo Dolls: Live In Alaska","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
