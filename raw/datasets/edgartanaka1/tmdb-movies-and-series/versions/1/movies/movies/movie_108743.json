Before she can even call her parents to let them know where she'll be, the lodge owners arrange her transport and she soon finds herself with two other young women as guests of a kindly old couple. The place is beautiful and the food is fantastic, but something just doesn't seem right. One of the guests has suddenly vanished, and the hosts are certainly reluctant to have anyone poking around the meat locker. Still, the barbecued ribs are delicious, so what's there to complain about?","popularity":2.36,"poster_path":"/6f9Ucn1HJLhrsVInRQSBqZwSoeJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Wolf Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":41243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Far West","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's a nice place to visit, but you WOULDN'T LIVE THERE!","title":"Terror at Red Wolf Inn","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":6}
