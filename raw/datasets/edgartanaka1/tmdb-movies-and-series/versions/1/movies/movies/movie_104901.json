These two elements suggest an implicit comparison between the treatment of space in Renaissance art and the moving image. The film marks a critical development in the artist's work in that he repeatedly employs a series of rapid pans and upward tilts along the city's buildings or facades, often integrating glimpses of his own face. As Beavers notes in his writing on the film, the camera movements are tied to the filmmakers' presence and suggests his investigative gaze.","popularity":1.756,"poster_path":"/zyxzHwHoyuxuV1qPhUkQ6z0z1hp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2000-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From the Notebook of...","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":10}
