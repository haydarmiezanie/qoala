A Fil-Am girl (Palermo) escapes the consequences of her State-side abortion by going back to her home country. With relatives greeting her with unwelcome arms, Joanna tries to make sense of her life and gets into the clutches of a smooth cybercafe owner (Gary Estrada) who introduces her to Web Diva.Com. She eventually becomes their big money-maker while catching a tentative affair with Spike (Carlo Maceda) -- a misguided hacker who (cheekily enough) created the Love virus in the movie.","popularity":0.72,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2003-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"www.XXX.com","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":2}
