As if drawn to her by cosmic force, he soon finds himself unwittingly in the company of his previous incarnation's wife. This woman, Marcia Curtis, recognizes in Peter startling characteristics which he shares with her dead husband, Jeff. Even the sound of his voice seems at times to be that of the dead man. Peter becomes romantically drawn to Ann Curtis who is or was his daughter (Jeff and Marcia's daughter). Recognizing the incestuous nature of their relationship, Mrs. Curtis tries to keep the two young people apart. But how? Must she reveal the terrible secret of the final minutes she shared with her husband in order to keep this man from her (their?) daughter?","popularity":4.846,"poster_path":"/yHsct1EhW3JExTlHfCZbmVlIogv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bing Crosby Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":11275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinerama Productions Corp.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Suppose you knew who you had been in your previous life.
