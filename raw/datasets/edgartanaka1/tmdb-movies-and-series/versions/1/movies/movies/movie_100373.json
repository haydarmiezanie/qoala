The police are unable to catch them, despite their predictability (and their endless sight gags). Finally, they get help from an unlikely source: the guy in the front of the theatre who sat through the picture before. They capture Killer, and he gets a long sentence, which he has to write on the blackboard 1,000 times.","popularity":3.304,"poster_path":"/bRYGQ6kyajIyVOIyup4miNaNWrD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Bros.
