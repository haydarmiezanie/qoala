Mechanical failure, lethal track design, fire and incompetence snuffed out dozens of young drivers. They had become almost expendable as eager young wannabes queued up at the top teams' gates waiting to take their place.  This is the story of when Grand Prix was out of control.  Featuring many famous drivers including three times world champion Sir Jackie Stewart OBE, twice world champion Emerson Fittipaldi and John Surtees OBE, this exciting but shocking film explores how Grand Prix drivers grew sick of their closest friends being killed and finally took control of their destiny.","popularity":2.667,"poster_path":"/9fGHfNZ7GXQXTMNArlHcMFDgHib.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/16fY7pucCzn7WSOYxOGRHlAayL3.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grand Prix: The Killer Years","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":9}
