Her death is followed by a number of attempted murders.  Carla's sister undertakes her own investigation.

However, he has a strong alibi (he was shooting a film).  The following night, a girl who manages to escape from the maniac's clutches swears he is a different famous actor but he turns out to have a strong alibi too!  Eventually the police set a trap in the park and, with the help of Carla, kill the madman.
