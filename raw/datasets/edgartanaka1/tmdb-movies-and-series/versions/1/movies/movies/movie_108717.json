Here, one wouldn't expect teenagers to burst out in song, or dance around cemeteries and streets. But, that's exactly what happens. Best pals Rodel, Billy, and Maribel find themselves in a state of limbo; fresh out of high school, they are just beginning to explore a new world of part-time mall jobs and crashing college parties. As newfound revelations and romances challenge their relationships with one another and their parents, the trio must assess what to hold onto, and how to best follow their dreams. It's a love song to the city, and to the residents who dream of a better (and more musical) life.","popularity":1.756,"poster_path":"/j5uMR8EOG1BfTgAxOi9hisFMBWN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colma: The Musical","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
