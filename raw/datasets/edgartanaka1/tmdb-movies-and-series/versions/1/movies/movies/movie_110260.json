Will it be blonde and virtuous Isabella or evil, dark-haired Malva? Each woman relies on a hero to locate the will. Malva hires the bare-chested strongman Samson while Isabella relies on the masked El Toro (a.k.a. Zorro) even though her heart belongs to the mild-mannered poet, Ramon. Malva's ruthless desire for the throne soon alienates Samson and he and El Toro then team up to bring about a proper resolution to the Nogara succession. Meanwhile, Isabella learns El Toto's true identity, an identity which both surprises and pleases her.","popularity":2.693,"poster_path":"/5myV8vUMNum0wrWAPPvHA5PQKli.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1963-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samson and the Slave Queen","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":3}
