They took refuge in a cheap no-name hotel they had heard about at 9, Rue Git le Coeur and were soon joined by William Burroughs, Ian Somerville, Brion Gysin, and others from England and elsewhere in Europe, seeking out the “freedom” that the Latin Quarter of Paris might provide.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Beat Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
