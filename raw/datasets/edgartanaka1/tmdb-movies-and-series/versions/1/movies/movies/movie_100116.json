Featuring many excerpts from her powerful speeches and insightful contributions from her political supporters and detractors, a portrait emerges of a woman whose strength of conviction eventually becomes the weakness of intransigence. And as British society threatens to break apart with street rioting, the grandees of her own party are beginning to sharpen their knives to remove the greatest female leader in world history... This program includes intimate footage of the Thatchers at home in Number 10, and unseen footage from her emotional and first major interview after her resignation as Prime Minister with Michael Brunson in 1992.","popularity":1.513,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margaret Thatcher: The Iron Lady","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
