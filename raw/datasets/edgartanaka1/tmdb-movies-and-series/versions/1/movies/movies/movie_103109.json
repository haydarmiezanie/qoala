The presence of God was powerfully evident throughout the night as His name was lifted on high.  These new songs are infused with life, energy and a heartfelt adoration for our Saviour. Our prayer is that you would be inspired to worship in spirit and truth as the message of Godâ€™s unfailing love and power is declared through these songs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hillsong - Mighty To Save","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
