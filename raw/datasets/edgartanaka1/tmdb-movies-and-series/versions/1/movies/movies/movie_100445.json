His ship encounters and sinks an American yacht and the single survivor, Sue Curry, is rescued by an American submarine, the \"Sea Serpent\", commanded by Commander Chris Warren. He hears her story and attempts to radio a warning to Pearl Harbor. Yamanada, hearing the signals, orders the airlines jammed, and then sends his son into the air to sink the sub. The attack fails, after the sub makes a crash dive, but they fail in their warning attempts. The next morning, December 7th, the men on the sub hear the story of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and devise a desperate plan to sink the Japanese carrier by letting the carrier know their position. The carrier comes in search of the submarine.","popularity":1.053,"poster_path":"/kT5DYyAwqeartutjlFt7xixieMT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Girl On A Sub Plays Desperate Hide-And-Seek With The Japs...
