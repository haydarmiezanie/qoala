The story shows a superb and foul-mouthed golfer that, after several tries, fails to hit the ball and is furious with his caddy, an innocent-looking boy who faithfully obeys the orders of his employer, despite the abuse to which he is submitted. Unsurprisingly, being a joke, it ends up with a shot funny surprise, obviously not to be revealed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Golf We Trust","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
