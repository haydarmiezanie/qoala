He covers translation in space, translation in time, rotation in space, the principle of reactivity, symmetry in atomic particles, changes in scale, uniform angular speed, and reflection in space. He also discusses the relationship between conservation laws and symmetry, and concludes with a brief look at antimatter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lecture 4: Symmetry in Physical Law","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
