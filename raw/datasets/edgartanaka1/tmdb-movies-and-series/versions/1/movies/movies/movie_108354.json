As Detective Dave Kominek (John Corbett) starts to discover similarities in the cases, he becomes determined to prove the seemingly unrelated killings are the work of one man. As the case unfolds and more victims come to light, a shocking twist comes into play – could the sadistic mass murderer possibly be a handsome, all-American athlete? The movie is from Ann Rule’s book, and also stars Sara Canning.","popularity":3.544,"poster_path":"/rA2xl8zk5GwV50A9u2S1rOWw9Eq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18518,"logo_path":null,"name":"Baumant Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":48782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Head First Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":59684,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beau Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hunt for the I-5 Killer","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":14}
