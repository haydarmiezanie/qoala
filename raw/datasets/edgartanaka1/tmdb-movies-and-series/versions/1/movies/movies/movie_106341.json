Sounds like a job for Steel's Angels, a crack anti terrorist outfit led by Lt.Col. Steel (retired Lt. Col. Us Army Special Force and much decorated Vietnam war hero) and fronted by some of the sexiest commando's ever to pick up a submachine gun.  State-of-the-art weaponry, rockets, fighter planes and action climax that rivals anything on film make RESCUE FORCE a must see for action film fans everywhere.","popularity":1.47,"poster_path":"/uSBw2ae1DGZiDPXoKBH86CmwJyT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Terrorism and revenge in the Middle East!","title":"Rescue Force","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
