D.A. Pennebaker, the now-legendary documentarian, filmed the production of the original cast recording, the back and forth between Sondheim and the performers, and the dynamic of trying to record live performance. The film climaxes with Elaine Stritch's performance of \"The Ladies Who Lunch\". The show won 6 Tony Awards including \"Best Musical\" and ran for two years on Broadway. A plan to make a series of \"Original Cast Album\" films never materialized.","popularity":2.006,"poster_path":"/ropG8u3VlmmYv8NKd6OMiql6jy6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Original Cast Album: Company","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5}
