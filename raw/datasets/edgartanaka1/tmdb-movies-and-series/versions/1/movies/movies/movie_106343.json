They melded punk and reggae into an innovative style that has yet to be copied. Their impact and influence can be heard in groups like Beastie Boys, No Doubt, Nirvana, Jane's Addiction and countless more. Despite the troubles of an eccentric front man they have stayed together for 30 years without ever reaching the level of success so many think they deserve. Using rare archival footage and original comic illustrations the film re-constructs Bad Brains' rich and complicated history.","popularity":1.973,"poster_path":"/djgAaUNXmajvSEm2FXnlpq4ZraC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15722,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmBuff","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Brains: A Band in DC","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
