And she's almost ready to commit to her longtime fianc√© when her sister Lucy - the personification of all that Jenny has been trying to flee - surprises her at a critical time. Lucy and Jenny's combustible reunion brings both of them to unforeseen places, shattering and reconstructing the worlds they have both carefully constructed.","popularity":4.941,"poster_path":"/4V4lqXgh3lFqlgRRaqj9rvE4xmf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Union Square","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":9}
