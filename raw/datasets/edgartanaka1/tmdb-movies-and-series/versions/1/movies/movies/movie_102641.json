Filming took place over a two-day period in March 1969 in a disused linoleum factory at Staines, England. Artists who were filmed included Led Zeppelin, Buddy Guy, Jack Bruce, Buddy Miles, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Chris Mercer, Eric Clapton, Jon Hiseman's Colosseum, Buddy Guy, Roland Kirk and Stephen Stills. This project also marks one of the rare film appearances of Glenn Ross Campbell and The Misunderstood. The whole project was planned with great secrecy and filming went ahead at a reputed cost of Â£100 per minute. The film received a limited run in London, premiering at the Lyceum Theatre in November 1969. Footage of Led Zeppelin's performance of the song \"Dazed and Confused\" which was originally filmed for Supershow later appeared on the Led Zeppelin DVD in 2003.
