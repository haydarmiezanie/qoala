Recreating its glorious past and chronicling its recent decline, Inventing Our Life focuses on the heartbreak and hope of the modern kibbutz, as a new generation struggles to insure its survival. Can a radically socialist institution survive a new market-driven reality with its ideological integrity intact? How will this affect the lives of the tens of thousands of people who still believe in the kibbutz experiment and continue to call it home? As the film progresses, the drama shifts from Can it survive? to Yes, but at what price?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inventing Our Life: The Kibbutz Experiment","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
