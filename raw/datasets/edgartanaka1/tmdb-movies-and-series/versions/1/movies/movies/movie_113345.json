Set in the famous Serengeti and the Ngorongoro crater, the film explores how the parks came to be and how western perceptions about nature radically altered both the East African landscape and society.  The film focuses on the people who \"shouldn't be there\", not only because their voices are rarely heard but also because they are still being antagonised and excluded, while the tourist industry is rapidly depleting the area's natural resources.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Place Without People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
