Even in our digital age, our computers are incapable of rendering these complex animations in real-time. This program was almost a year in the making, resulting in an experience that is simultaneously technological, nostalgic, beautiful and sublime. It's colorful and evolving art with the power to transform a room completely. BluScenes: The Fractal Plane includes two Ursitti compositions, “The Fractal Plane” and the “Mathematical Daydreams,” both with original 7.1 scores composed and performed by Chris Martyn and Geoff Harvey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BluScenes: The Fractal Plane","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
