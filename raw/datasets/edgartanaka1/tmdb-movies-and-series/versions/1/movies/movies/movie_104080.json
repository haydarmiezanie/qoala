Cannonball Adderley (alto sax), Nat Adderley (cornet) and the masterful Yusef Lateef (tenor sax, flute, oboe), provide a massive three-horn frontline attack, while the stellar rhythm section featuring a pre-Weather Report Joe Zawinul (piano), Sam Jones (bass) and Louis Hayes (drums) fuel the songs with a deep infectious swing. Quincy Jones’ “Jessica’s Day” leaps from the gate with a huge “big band” sound that is extraordinary for only six musicians. This DVD is a reminder that Cannonball Adderley was one of the most outstanding and highly respected alto saxophonists in the history of jazz, a blues-based jazzman who could play anything in superb fashion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jazz Icons: Cannonball Adderley: Live in '63","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
