After a three-hour performance in front of 200,000 people at Mexico City's historic central square, the Zócalo, the ex-Beatle proved that not only is he as talented as ever, but he is as eternally charming and energetic as one would expect from the former mop-topped demigod.  McCartney amped the crowd at the Zocalo by yelling \"¡Viva Mexico, Cabrones!\" -- a sure fire way to get the crowd up onto their feet -- and made sure to pepper Mexican slang into a few of the songs performed that night. For good measure, Sir Paul also waved the Mexican flag.  During the concert, McCartney was joined by a traditional Mexican mariachi band for the Beatles' classic, Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, an evening highlight that will not be forgotten anytime soon by the masses in attendance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Paul McCartney is ON THE RUN","title":"Paul McCartney ON THE RUN","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
