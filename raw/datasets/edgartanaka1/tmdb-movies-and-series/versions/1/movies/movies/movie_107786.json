At 19, a professor at the Conservatory of Music in Madrid heard him singing for the first time and offered him a scholarship to continue his studies. His artistic life runs between continued success, becoming the world's greatest tenor. But in 1890, while singing at the Teatro Real in Madrid, a failure in his voice is like a cruel reminder of what would happen a few days later: his death at a young age. The doctors gave a diagnosis, but his friends know that Julian Gayarre died because he could not sing anymore.","popularity":1.174,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romanza final (Gayarre)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
