This is not a film by Khavn. Gruesome and grisly murders are our entry point into the psyche of the Aswang of Quezon City. More a meditation on the workings of a disturbed mind than a detective thriller, it nonetheless shows us a cat and mouse mind game. We watch and squirm in terror as the Pinoy vampire strikes again and again. Contains scenes of extreme this, that ... and the other thing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vampire of Quezon City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
