Tapiovaara stresses the divided loyalties of the Finnish bourgeoisie, torn between preserving their privileged economic position and taking a risky stand for an independent Finland. Stolen Death can be viewed as a thinly disguised protest against the rise of the fascist movement in Finland in the 1930s. Tapiovaara's allegorical indictment of class inequality and the suppression of free speech and political expression, coupled with his death at 28 fighting the Russians in the Winter War of 1939-1940, earned him almost a mythic status in Finland.","popularity":2.971,"poster_path":"/mxuOHdbgNjwj7SdkvkchBJXK6uX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Erik Blomberg","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1938-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stolen Death","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
