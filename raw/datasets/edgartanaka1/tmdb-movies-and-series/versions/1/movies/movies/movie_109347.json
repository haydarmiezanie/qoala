Instead of clearing the endangered area, skiers are allowed to remain 'for the rest of the day'. Nature doesn't wait till after business hours, so the crystallized wave rushes down and crushes everything on its path, including a brand new hotel; among the guests is the architect Michael Cooper's own family, which now tries to remember the plans well enough to find the way out, as he tries to instruct the rescue operation above, where a second, even larger avalanche is expected.","popularity":3.564,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28864,"logo_path":"/h9SuMmWNAaKNqCx0AJ58Qrn8ILz.png","name":"PorchLight Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":26646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edgewood Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A thundering roar.
