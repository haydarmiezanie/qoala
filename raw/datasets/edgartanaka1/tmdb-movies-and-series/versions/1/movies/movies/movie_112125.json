Well, you get Sagakkal. Director Muthukumarasamy’s Sagakkal is a retake of the long forgotten eighties with all the excess melodrama surrounding a wafer thin tale of love and friendship.  The movie has an amateurish look and feel. Cinematography is a letdown and songs are just about okay. Director Muthukumarasamy must tune his direction to suit to the sensibilities of the target audience. Otherwise, his product will be stuck in the middle for want of audience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sagakkal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
