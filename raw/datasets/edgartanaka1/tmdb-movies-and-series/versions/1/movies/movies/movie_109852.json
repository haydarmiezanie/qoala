While Björk fans have occasionally complained about the amount of repackaging of her albums, Voltaic reaffirms just how important the live aspect is to her music, and provides a couple of different perspectives on it as well. Volta sparked a particularly inspired and lavish tour that, arguably, ended up being bigger than the actual album was, but tapped into the most dramatic, primal, and elegant aspects of Björk's art overall. It's fitting, then, that the chronicles of the Volta tour are just as thoughtfully crafted as the shows were.","popularity":0.781,"poster_path":"/q1x85SWTE5DxBwDKaTSvUknPqtO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bjork - Voltaic Live","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":3}
