One day, her favorite mirror which was given to Akko by her mother (or in some versions, by her father, as a present from India) is broken, and she prefers to bury it in her yard rather than throw it to the trash can. In her dreams, she is contacted by a spirit (or in some cases the Queen of the Mirror Kingdom) who is touched that the girl would treat the mirror so respectfully and not simply throw it away. Akko-chan is then given the gift of a magical mirror and taught enchantments, such as \"Tekumaku mayakon, tekumaku mayakon\" and \"Lamipasu lamipasu lu lu lu lu lu\", that will allow her to transform into anything she wishes.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/4ig65nfnEMciukmC2KXKVehA1Bn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5542,"logo_path":"/ayE4LIqoAWotavo7xdvYngwqGML.png","name":"Toei Animation","origin_country":"JP"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1998-04-05","episode_count":44,"id":149490,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
