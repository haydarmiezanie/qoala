The specials were generally broadcast four to six times a year during the school year, pre-empting local programming that would usually follow the network schedule in the late afternoon hours.\n\nCBS distributed its own productions as the CBS Afternoon Playhouse. CBS also had a program called Famous Classic Tales, which aired Australian cartoons that were adapted from literature books. NBC had afterschool programs under the umbrella title Special Treat, while ABC had the ABC Afterschool Special.
