We then take an angle grinder to it and cut it to pieces. It's only then that the customised rebuilding process starts.\n\nWe're trying to create one of the fastest Minis on the planet. We're going to rebuild it with the engine and running gear from a Toyota Celica ST185 GT4. Or at least that's the plan. Whether it comes off or not is another matter. We're filming this as it happens so what you see is only a few weeks behind where we're actually at so we're not sure yet whether we can do it. That's kind of the fun though.  Stick with us through the highs and the lows of the project. Hopefully it'll be worth the agony and cash.  Feel free to share it far and wide!\n\nThanks for watching.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9qNpTxBl74k5gddLcnvD3KLVqEk.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2013-08-17","episode_count":30,"id":144537,"name":"Project Binky","overview":"","poster_path":"/9qNpTxBl74k5gddLcnvD3KLVqEk.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Documentary","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
