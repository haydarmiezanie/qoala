In spite of its cancellation, Witchblade was ranked seventh in the Top 10 Basic Cable Dramas for 2002.\n\nAccording to Top Cow editor Matt Hawkins the Witchblade TV series was cancelled because the lead actress Yancy Butler was an alcoholic and went into rehab â€“ it was and remains the highest rated TV series to be cancelled.","popularity":7.193,"poster_path":"/s7beqiNqkx9Bi9qHSi8Zo2rSEpg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Halsted Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":2528,"logo_path":"/5OZP2dM6B6wBXfwadqk0TJBBPJP.png","name":"Top Cow Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":3,"id":20186,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"2000-08-27","episode_count":12,"id":20185,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/pLCMXtCbQ0eVpRUk53KRTeUJ8xX.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":"2002-06-16","episode_count":12,"id":20184,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/77637sZQhGseCZMgI0JLb2QqPPG.jpg","season_number":2}],"status":"Canceled","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":26}
