Produced by Jay Ward Productions, the series is structured as a variety show, with the main feature being the serialized adventures of the two title characters, the anthropomorphic moose Bullwinkle and flying squirrel Rocky. The main adversaries in most of their adventures are the Russian-like spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. Supporting segments include Dudley Do-Right, Peabody's Improbable History, and Fractured Fairy Tales, among others.\n\nRocky & Bullwinkle is known for quality writing and wry humor. Mixing puns, cultural and topical satire, and self-referential humor, it appealed to adults as well as children. It was also one of the first cartoons whose animation was outsourced; storyboards were shipped to Gamma Productions, a Mexican studio also employed by Total Television. Thus the art has a choppy, unpolished look and the animation is extremely limited even by television animation standards. Yet the series has long been held in high esteem by those who have seen it; some critics described the series as a well-written radio program with pictures.","popularity":12.523,"poster_path":"/tBfHPHYgHHbuwunjpWfoMsVtFSd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jay Ward Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":67003,"logo_path":null,"name":"P.A.T.","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1959-11-19","episode_count":130,"id":63775,"name":"Season 1","overview":"Jet Fuel Formula is the first and the longest Rocky and Bullwinkle story arc and is the pilot of The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends. (Jet Fuel Formula covers forty episodes while the average story arc includes approximately sixteen.) It is also noteworthy in that it established most of the characters, themes, running gags, and other elements that would be employed in later stories and that would become so closely identified with the Rocky and Bullwinkle programs in the years since. The first few episodes contained a laugh track, which was removed when the episodes were released as part of Rocky \u0026 Bullwinkle \u0026 Friends Complete Season 1.\n\nIn spite of the title, the story actually concerns the pursuit of a formula for rocket fuel.","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1960-09-24","episode_count":260,"id":63776,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"1961-11-12","episode_count":165,"id":63777,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"1962-06-08","episode_count":95,"id":63778,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4},{"air_date":"1962-08-19","episode_count":165,"id":63779,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":22}
