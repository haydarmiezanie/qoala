The format is of an internet scavenger hunt that is offering chances to win $US50,000, $100,000 and $1,000,000.\n\nGold Rush consists of 13 rounds of game play. In order to qualify for a chance to win, participants will have to correctly complete a series of tasks on AOL.com’s Gold Rush hub in order to stockpile virtual gold bars. Many of these tasks will consist of pop culture trivia challenges. Clues to help solve each of the challenges will be found in CBS Television programs and commercials, magazines, radio, song lyrics, and on AOL.\n\nIn each round, the first three players who complete the challenges and collect 12 virtual gold bars will be taken to a location somewhere in the United States where they will compete on-camera in a head-to-head, reality-style competition for a chance to win $100,000 in gold. In the Finale Round of Gold Rush, the 12 previous $100,000 winners return, joined by 6 new contestants, to vie for the $1 million grand prize.\n\nVarious companies have all signed on as partners of Gold Rush. Each company’s brand will be integrated into various parts of Gold Rush, including game clues and challenges throughout the game.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tU92PGKvRXi2D0zTGUiNrPjwgLA.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
