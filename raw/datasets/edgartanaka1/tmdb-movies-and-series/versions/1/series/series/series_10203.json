In the telecasts, Chris Schenkel and the graphics displayed during the show would refer to the show as \"The Professional Bowlers Tour\", possibly to disambiguate from the NFL's use of the term \"pro bowler\" when referring to players who were selected for the Pro Bowl - an event also televised on ABC for many years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
