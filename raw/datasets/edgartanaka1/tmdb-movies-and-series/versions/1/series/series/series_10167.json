It aired in syndication by Gold Key Media from 1980â€“1982 and by All American Television from 1982-1992. The show was hosted by Casey Kasem, the host of American Top 40 and Casey's Top 40, until 1991. After that point, the show was hosted by Siedah Garrett and then Tommy Puett; Kasem later returned as host until he closed down the show in 1992 to focus on launching \"Casey's Countdown,\" an adult contemporary music spinoff of Casey's Top 40. From around 1987 onwards, the show was also transmitted by various regions of ITV in the United Kingdom, where it was often broadcast as part of the network's then-new overnight service.\n\nCharlie Tuna served as announcer, and Syd Vinnedge, who would later become executive producer of The Price Is Right, was producer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":0,"id":59520,"name":"America's Top 10 ","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":0,"id":59521,"name":"America's Top 10","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":2}
