Bu Young Bae is the owner of a 50-year-old Pyongyang cold noodle restaurant whose health scare causes his children to quarrel over his vast wealth. Feeling betrayed by their behavior, he decides to marry Gye Ok, a 33-year-old single maid enticed by Young Ba’es fortune and big family, under false pretenses. The move shocks his sons, but Gye Ok's strong work ethic makes Young Bae realize that she’ll be able to keep his cold noodle restaurant afloat. Unlike his siblings, Young Bae’s independent and headstrong son Bu Seol Ak isn’t interested in his wealth or family drama, but his disdain for Gye Ok and her presence in his aging father’s life motivates him to get involved, bringing the two adversaries closer together in unexpected ways.","popularity":1.554,"poster_path":"/alG86Q5tmU6ny8JSjUDrBCV9ZRX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106339,"logo_path":"/kwr4zdwiIjwxt1iP8e80QZzExAb.png","name":"Korean Broadcasting System (KBS)","origin_country":"KR"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2020-04-20","episode_count":61,"id":147814,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/gnysgnKEjn8o8rUydoeblx7y0uL.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
