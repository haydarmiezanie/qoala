The show largely consisted of sketch comedy in short segments, much in the tradition of earlier Sketch comedy shows, The Mavis Bramston Show, The Naked Vicar Show, Australia You're Standing In It, and The D-Generation. The majority of the filming took place in Melbourne, Victoria. The show had a significant effect on Australian culture, particularly on Australian youth. The Australian adoption of the word \"Bogan\" was first used in its existing context by the The Comedy Company character, Kylie Mole.\n\n","popularity":0.99,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":20035,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":20034,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
