During the early 2000s, it ran on Fox Kids (and later Jetix) in the United Kingdom, on Fox Kids in Australia and on RTÉ Two in the Republic of Ireland. RTÉ Two has not shown the series since 2004, and on Jetix UK, the series was eventually relegated to shorts in-between programs, with more edits. The dub is of American origin, with veteran voice actors such as Kath Soucie, Russi Taylor, Grey DeLisle, Pat Fraley, Eric Loomis and Anndi McAfee playing the characters. Soucie voiced Shin and Misae.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9LWl9g4jHlf1xniI2EMntZVpQh5.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2020-01-01","episode_count":2,"id":150338,"name":"Specials","overview":"This season contains the special extras and episodes from the Vitello dub of Shin Chan","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"2002-01-01","episode_count":52,"id":150290,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/9LWl9g4jHlf1xniI2EMntZVpQh5.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
