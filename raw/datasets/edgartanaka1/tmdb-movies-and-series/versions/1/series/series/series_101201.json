Too painful! Nothing but fluff? Too sugary! Come watch B&S, the show where you'll never guess the ending…","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k1UYT9m9lnQC0VR6fmYzU6N3k5Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haoliners Animation League","origin_country":""},{"id":109474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tencent Animation & Comics","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2018-08-27","episode_count":29,"id":146439,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/ddR3wZEirynw9hJRrP83ocmOkEU.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
