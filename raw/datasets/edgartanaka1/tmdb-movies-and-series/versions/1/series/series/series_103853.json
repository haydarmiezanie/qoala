Many make a living testing cars, just like the real ones.\n\nThe story begins with crash dummy professor Dr. Zub has creating a new \"uncrashable\" prototype armor called the Torso 9000 and is testing it with the help of crash dummy Ted. Unfortunately the initial trial run goes awry and Ted's head is severed from his body. The following night however, Ted is accidentally replaced with the head of the evil Junkman, who can now harness the power of the Torso 9000 and manages to break free from the Crash Test facility.[3]\n\nPlotting to destroy the crash dummies, the Junkman sets up his base near an abandoned scrap heap and creates an army of killing machines out of spare car parts. When a valuable disc of information on the Torso 9000 is stolen, and finally Dr. Zub himself is kidnapped, heroes Slick & Spin step in to save the day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/afEg7LW3K8JAOvJ0pzpnIX38v5Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lamb and Company","origin_country":""},{"id":3959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nelvana","origin_country":"CA"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1993-05-16","episode_count":1,"id":151623,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Pilot","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
