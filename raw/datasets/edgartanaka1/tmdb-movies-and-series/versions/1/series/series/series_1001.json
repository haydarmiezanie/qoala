An example was when he invited three of his workers from his Homebase in Louisiana to cook up some healthy recipes.\n\nHis \"Essence of Emeril\" set has a wine cabinet, a built-in deep fryer, and other appliances. When he cooks with a specific ingredient he explains what it is and how it is made.","popularity":3.674,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":99,"id":2867,"name":"season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":2869,"name":"Season 10","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":10},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":5,"id":2871,"name":"Season 12","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":12},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":2870,"name":"Season 13","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":13},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":5,"id":2873,"name":"season 14","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":14},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":3,"id":2872,"name":"Season 15","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":15}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
