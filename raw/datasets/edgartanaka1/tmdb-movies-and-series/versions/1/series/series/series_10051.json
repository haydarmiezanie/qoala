It was first seen in 1969 with Rod Serling as host, and returned for a three-season run from 1976-1979, after airing as a local series on Los Angeles' KTLA in 1974-75 season. Bill Armstrong was the original host, soon succeeded by Allen Ludden, with Bill Berry and Joe Seiter sharing the announcing duties.\n\nIt was later revived for almost one year from 1988-1989 as The New Liar's Club; Chicago native Eric Boardman was the host, and former emcee Bill Armstrong was announcer. This version was produced by Blair Murdoch at CKVU-TV in Vancouver, with Stan Litke as the director for the first half of its run, later replaced by Dave Stewart. A pilot for a new version in 1996 was done with Ed McMahon hosting, but the series did not sell. The title is a pun on the Friars Club.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
