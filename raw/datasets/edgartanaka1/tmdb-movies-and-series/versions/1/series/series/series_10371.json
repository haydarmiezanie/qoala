The play though has been radically overhauled with Robin Hood all but written out and a romance has been concocted between Marion and Friar Tuck. Tucker and Becca both realize that they have more than friendly feelings for each other. They shyly tell each other on the phone the past times that they each crushed on the other and are surprised to learn they never liked each other at the same time...until now. On the night of the performance Tucker and Becca share their first real kiss while rehearsing backstage.","production_code":"","season_number":1,"show_id":10371,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},"name":"Flash Forward","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"name":"ABC","id":2,"logo_path":"/ndAvF4JLsliGreX87jAc9GdjmJY.png","origin_country":"US"},{"name":"Disney Channel","id":54,"logo_path":"/rxhJszKVAvAZYTmF0vfRHfyo4Fb.png","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":26,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["CA"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Flash Forward","overview":"A look at the lives of two best friends and neighbors since birth, Tucker and Rebecca, and their respective adventures as they travel through the world of eighth grade.","popularity":3.501,"poster_path":"/1oLAoojV2oCTAVeQFREYfNCPA1b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantis Films","origin_country":""},{"id":670,"logo_path":"/rRGi5UkwvdOPSfr5Xf42RZUsYgd.png","name":"Walt Disney Television","origin_country":"US"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":20439,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"1995-12-14","episode_count":26,"id":20440,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
