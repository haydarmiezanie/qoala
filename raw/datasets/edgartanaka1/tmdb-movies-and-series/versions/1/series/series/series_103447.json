Miraculously, she survives with the loss of all memory and wakes up with a new life as she takes on the identity of Meen. Mind and Meen couldn’t be more different, of course, besides the fact that they are identical twins. Living as Meen, Mind is granted the opportunity to meet Natee, a young swimming athlete who is Meen's close friend, and Gunkan, a mischievous handsome boy at the school who later comes to help her recover her lost memories. But, as time passes, unveiling the truth causes her to feel more pain than she had ever experienced.","popularity":1.594,"poster_path":"/5ek8W4he3nwpJSXugxuzpE2zr1L.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2020-05-02","episode_count":89,"id":150834,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/sxsI10qBAKtFk7Cg5tTc5mvWEgT.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
