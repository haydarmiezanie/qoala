Each show consisted of two episodes, the first being an adaptation of one of the books, the second being an original story.\n\nThe series was nominated in 1987 for a Daytime Emmy award for Outstanding Performer in Children's Programming; it was also nominated that year for a Humanitas Prize in the category of Non-Prime Time Children's Animated Show.\n\nReruns aired briefly on TLC's Ready Set Learn block from September 28 to November 13, 1998 when a contract dispute forced TLC to pull the show off the schedule. During the early 2000s, reruns were later seen as part of a kids' programming block from DiC Entertainment on the now-defunct UPN, but the episodes were edited and time-compressed by DiC.","popularity":8.87,"poster_path":"/d6ZV08jRKuhQxazDvcHADCsuOUk.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1979-12-03","episode_count":12,"id":20371,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"1985-09-14","episode_count":26,"id":20369,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1986-09-13","episode_count":26,"id":20370,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"2003-01-06","episode_count":61,"id":20372,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"2003-09-15","episode_count":34,"id":20373,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4},{"air_date":"2004-04-05","episode_count":23,"id":91977,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":14}
