The two teams trade baskets, and the score is tied with two minutes to play.  The Hoopstars commit a few key turnovers and wind up losing.  Although they are disappointed by the setback, they can still make the championship game with a victory that night.  They come out very flat, and wind up getting blown out.  The lone bright spot comes when Ashley Burtsfield finally gets a chance to play and makes several three-pointers.  The Hoopstars are proud of their overall performance, but upset by the fact that they must now go their separate ways.  The players look back on the season and talk about the close bond they have formed as teammates.","production_code":"","season_number":1,"show_id":10249,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},"name":"Totally Hoops","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"name":"Disney Channel","id":54,"logo_path":"/rxhJszKVAvAZYTmF0vfRHfyo4Fb.png","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":16,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Totally Hoops","overview":"Totally Hoops is a Disney Channel reality series.
