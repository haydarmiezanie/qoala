Hosted by Mistress Juliya, it served as a slightly more subtle incarnation of the popular Uranium and even coexisted with it under the same host. Metal Asylum traditionally ran a half hour, typically on a nightly basis at 11pm ET, and deemphasized band interviews in favor of simply playing music videos, largely of the heavy metal genre. The show's production ended in 2006 due to Chernetsky's departure from Fuse TV.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
