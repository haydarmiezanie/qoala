This version was hosted by Brian Robbins, and aired in between June and September of 1989 with 65 episodes. The show was distributed by MCA TV and was a production of Barry & Enright Productions.\n\nThe score was kept by \"Felicity\", who turned a knob to pour plastic beads into a container until they reached the amount of the team's score. Felicity inexplicably left the show for several weeks during the middle of the run, during which time the score was kept by Robbins.\n\nRules explanations and close calls were handled by a bald, mustachioed judge nicknamed \"Judge Mental\" who sat in a mock-up judge's bench atop the scoring device, and would always be booed by the audience upon his introduction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1989-06-05","episode_count":1,"id":72507,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
