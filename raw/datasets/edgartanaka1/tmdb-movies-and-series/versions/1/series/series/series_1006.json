It was created and written by Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer. The series was considered daring at the time due to its subject matter of a man sharing a flat with two single women. It was made by Thames Television and recorded at their Teddington studios.\n\nTwo spin-off series were later made: George and Mildred and Robin's nest. In 2004, it came 69th in a poll to find Britain's best sitcom. The series was remade in the United States as Three's company in 1977.
