The production was the brainchild of producer Steve Krantz, in an attempt to capitalize on the phenomenal success of ABC's daytime serial Dark Shadows. To develop this series, Krantz hired actor-writer Ian Martin and veteran TV and radio producer Jerry Layton, both of who would be given screen credit for the creation of Strange Paradise. With the CBC and American broadcasters Metromedia and Kaiser Broadcasting handling distribution and co-production, the series was produced in Ottawa at CTV affiliate CJOH-TV and aired for 39 weeks, presenting three separate 13-week story arcs.","popularity":5.646,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1969-10-20","episode_count":195,"id":20323,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/jVtDGQUvlpxdayKVxtLfGdEMnhw.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
