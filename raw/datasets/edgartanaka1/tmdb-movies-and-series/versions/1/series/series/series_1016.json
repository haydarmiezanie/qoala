Commentators included Ray Moore and Bruce Hammal.\n\nIn 2004, a re-launched celebrity version entitled Strictly Come Dancing, hosted by Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly, debuted on BBC One, and became a popular hit on Saturday evenings. The format of the newer show has been successfully exported to other countries under the name Dancing with the Stars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/36uWQiT0CfP2NAUcoKBrfTV40HL.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
