It’s a time when the National Park is at its colourful best. The fall sees thousands of fieldfares arriving from Europe who are escaping from the colder continent to the relatively less severe climate of Wales. In a water mill in the Usk Valley, bats feed up for the last few nights before they disappear to hibernate in caves. Water birds are also arriving on Talybont Reservoir ready for winter. Iolo looks for cave spiders and discovers hundreds of sea trout migrate upstream to the Carmarthenshire uplands.","production_code":"","season_number":1,"show_id":100471,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},"name":"Iolo's Brecon Beacons","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[],"number_of_episodes":4,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":[],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Iolo's Brecon Beacons","overview":"Iolo Williams explores the Brecon Beacons over a period of one whole year.
