It is displayed on social media as well as Noor Dubai, MBC1 and Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe program presents realistic social situations that a young man from the United Arab Emirates called “Ghaith” helps them in different countries like Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Uganda and others. The duration of one episode ranges between 8-15 minutes, as the program presents 30 humanitarian cases every Ramadan. There were 3 seasons of it until Ramadan 2020, and there was a short season called the Extra Season, which included 8 episodes that were shown in November 2019.\n\nThe presidents of the program intent on making the \"Ghaith\" anonymous, to focus primarily on doing good and not on the person doing the task, so the second season witnessed a change in Ghaith's clothes, in order to reduce the chances of his knowledge among the audience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vVc6vO8NpYV1EEht8mQTyv2FIax.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2020-04-24","episode_count":4,"id":149142,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/vVc6vO8NpYV1EEht8mQTyv2FIax.jpg","season_number":3}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
