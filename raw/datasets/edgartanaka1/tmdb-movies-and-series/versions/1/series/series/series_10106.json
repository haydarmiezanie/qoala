It was a parody of kung fu shows and movies of the time.\n\nThe main character Hong Kong Phooey is a clownishly clumsy secret alter ego of Penrod \"Penry\" Pooch, working at a police station as a \"mild-mannered\" janitor under the glare of Sergeant Flint. He transforms himself into Hong Kong Phooey upon running into a magic filing cabinet despite always getting stuck - and unstuck by his cat Spot - and once transformed, gets equipped with the \"Phooeymobile\" vehicle that transforms itself into a boat, a plane, or a telephone booth depending on the circumstances. He fights crime relying on his copy of The Hong Kong Book of Kung Fu, but he succeeds only thanks to his cat Spot who provides a solution to the challenges or they are solved by himself as result of a comically unintended side effect of his conscious efforts. Background was designed by Lorraine Andrina and Richard Khim.","popularity":4.748,"poster_path":"/cQA2gIsFz598aann5zVXL2VRkqE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1353,"logo_path":"/yXhCcOFK5Fy3ZBQwhBYx8Zu9ZIw.png","name":"Hanna-Barbera Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":20059,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"1974-09-07","episode_count":22,"id":20058,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/tDq5vfx2kPY4QSHswTXzGfpSv9w.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":20057,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2}],"status":"Ended","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":30}
