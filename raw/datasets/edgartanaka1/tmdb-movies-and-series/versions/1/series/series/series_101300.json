INSANITY MAX:30 makes people push as hard as they can for as long as they can until they MAX OUT - the point when they just can't do any more or they begin to lose good form.  They'll then note their MAX OUT time, recover, and finish the rest of the workout. Every day they'll push to increase their previous MAX OUT time so they constantly progress, improve their fitness, and get the full body results they've always wanted.  And for the first time the program includes a low-impact modifier for every move so anyone at any level can MAX OUT without the impact to their joints.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hBSqLfkAZQiqWVWVkay64UhXUyM.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2014-12-02","episode_count":13,"id":146669,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
