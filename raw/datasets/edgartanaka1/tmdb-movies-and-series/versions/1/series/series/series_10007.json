Follies is a syndicated sitcom which aired from 1987â€“1989 and was set in a Washington, D.C. bar, where bartender Fred Willard would welcome puppet caricatures of that day's politicians and celebrities. The humor tended to be on the satirical side, often taking potshots at politicians and the political process. Although Willard was the only live actor appearing regularly, each episode brought a celebrity guest into the bar, such as Martin Mull, Robin Leach, Bob Uecker, and Betty White. In one episode, Robert Englund showed up as his Freddie Kruger character, and in a special Christmas episode an un-billed actor played Santa Claus. Another episode had Mike Tyson confront his own puppet character.\n\nThe show was believed to be inspired by the British series Spitting Image. It was syndicated in many markets, although it often aired at odd hours, making it difficult for the show to build a following. It was produced by Sid and Marty Krofft.","popularity":1.201,"poster_path":"/1xWgOFPPUfBRM8aigQqKjEpURyw.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1987-09-15","episode_count":24,"id":19933,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
