Each week, he and his guests put on standard TV variety fare of the era. Two recurring features were a skit about the effort involved in putting a weekly television series on the air, much in the spirit of The Jack Benny Show, and The Front Porch, in which Don and a guest would sit in rocking chairs and quietly discuss their philosophies of life. Notable regulars in his cast included Elaine Joyce and Gary Burghoff, who had previously portrayed \"Radar O'Reilly\" in the film version of M*A*S*H and was about to achieve his greatest fame in reprising that role for the television version of it.","popularity":3.305,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":66717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tomka Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1970-09-22","episode_count":25,"id":20197,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
