It revolves around brothers Demetrius \"Big Meech\" Flenory and Terry \"Southwest T\" Flenory, who together took their vision beyond the drug trade and into the world of hip-hop. The drama, per Starz, will tell a story about love, family and capitalism in the pursuit of the American dream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28523,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lionsgate Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":45147,"logo_path":"/sLv0CvsijmrzpzPCuiNigJp5YHF.png","name":"G-Unit Film & Television","origin_country":"US"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":147234,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Planned","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
