In a small Tartar village, a woman named Zuleikha watches as her husband is murdered by communists. Zuleikha herself is sent into exile, enduring a horrendous train journey to a remote spot on the Angara River in Siberia. Conditions in the camp are tough, and many of her group do not survive the first difficult winter. As she gradually settles into a routine, Zuleikha starts to get to know her companions. The eclectic group includes a rather dotty doctor, an artist who paints on the sly, and Ignatov, Zuleikha's husband's killer. A screen version of the best-selling novel by Guzel Yakhina.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/wY1EAtRHkOa7jO9OU9Cs8qGd5lK.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2020-04-13","episode_count":8,"id":148142,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/wY1EAtRHkOa7jO9OU9Cs8qGd5lK.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
