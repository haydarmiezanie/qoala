Maddie visits a planetarium to learn how stars work. She discovers that stars are made in space by dust and gas, and when they press together, they get really, really hot and light up! She finds out that the sun is also a star, but because it’s closer to the Earth it looks much bigger than the stars we can see in space. She uses a special recording telescope camera to see the stars and moon really close up. Next, Maddie heads to an animation studio to see how a special type of film called a stop-frame animation film is made using puppets. She uses her special time-lapse camera to film the puppets as they only move a tiny bit at a time – it takes a whole day to put together just ten seconds of stop-frame animation!","production_code":"","season_number":4,"show_id":102760,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},"name":"Maddie's Do You Know?","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"name":"CBeebies","id":166,"logo_path":"/h05xw1JP88QtiOtvFw8HENlFafx.png","origin_country":"GB"}],"number_of_episodes":52,"number_of_seasons":4,"origin_country":["GB"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Maddie's Do You Know?","overview":"Maddie Moate discovers how things work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kT0rFphrwziMVSL2IJPxkSZ0P8i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/16fY7pucCzn7WSOYxOGRHlAayL3.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2016-09-05","episode_count":25,"id":149442,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"2018-04-03","episode_count":25,"id":149444,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"2019-04-29","episode_count":1,"id":149445,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"2020-04-20","episode_count":1,"id":149447,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Documentary","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
