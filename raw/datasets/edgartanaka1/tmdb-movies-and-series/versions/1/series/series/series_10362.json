Fandango was the first TV game show to air on TNN and was one of the longest-running game shows on a cable network.\n\nThe show was hosted by singer Bill Anderson, who was joined by Blake Pickett as co-host in 1987. Disc jockey Charlie Chase has sometimes been identified as the voice of \"Edgar the Talking Jukebox\", but Anderson's autobiography Whisperin' Bill names Edgar's voice as being that of Anderson's long-time friend, radio announcer Bill Robinson.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reid-Land Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":59159,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Nashville Network (TNN)","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1983-03-08","episode_count":1,"id":93517,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
