A companion show to Club MTV, Street Party aired dance videos. Unlike other genre shows like Headbangers Ball and 120 Minutes, Street Party was more of a video block that's length changed each week from 2 to 4 to even once 24 hours. VJ segments are reported to have been taped on the Club MTV set. In 1992, MTV lost interest in dance music and cancelled both Club MTV and Street Party, as well as removing dance videos from general rotation both on MTV and VH1.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
