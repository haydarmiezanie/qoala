In today's show they don diving suits to swim with seals and hire an unusual mode of transport to take them around the islands. Galton visits a sea salt farm and delivers some back to James, who uses it to cook up some wonderful salt-baked sea bass.  James finds an unusual restaurant situated in the middle of a post office and finishes off the day cooking roast duck by a stunning seashore.","production_code":"","season_number":1,"show_id":102193,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},"name":"James Martin's Islands to Highlands","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[],"number_of_episodes":1,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":[],"original_language":"en","original_name":"James Martin's Islands to Highlands","overview":"James Martin sets off on his foodie travels across the UK.
