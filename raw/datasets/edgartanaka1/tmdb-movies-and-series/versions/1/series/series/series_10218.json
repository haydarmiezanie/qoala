The premiere episode introduces Skip Tarkenton, a somewhat naive and optimistic young man who has come to Hollywood looking for a job as a cartoonist. When he arrives at a low-budget animation company called Buddy Winkler Productions, he finds out Buddy Winkler has just died, and the company desperately needs new blood. So Skip gets an animation job at the firm, which is nicknamed \"The Duck Factory\" as their main cartoon is \"The Dippy Duck Show\".\n\nOther Duck Factory employees seen regularly on the show were man-of-a-thousand-cartoon voices Wally Wooster; comedy writer Marty Fenneman; artists Brooks Carmichael and Roland Culp, editor Andrea Lewin, and business manager Aggie Aylesworth. Buddy Winkler Productions was now owned by his young, ditzy widow, Mrs Sheree Winkler, who had been married to Buddy for all of three weeks before his death.\n\nThe Duck Factory lasted thirteen episodes; it premiered April 12, 1984. The show initially aired at 9:30 on Thursday nights, directly after Cheers, and replaced Buffalo Bill on NBC's schedule. Jay Tarses, an actor on The Duck Factory, had been the co-creator and executive producer of Buffalo Bill, which had its final network telecast on Thursday, April 5, 1984.","popularity":1.903,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15847,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTM Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1984-04-12","episode_count":13,"id":20217,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
