It was broadcast on the NBC network during the 1983-1984 season. It was produced by Paul Freeman.\n\nThe series was at least partly inspired by the more coltish elements of the soap opera Dallas, and dealt with the intrigues of the Texas-based ranch-owning Champion family. The show's cast included Sam Elliott, David Soul, Edward Albert, Cybill Shepherd, Chuck Connors, Noah Beery, Jr., Ken Curtis, Robin Wright and Jane Russell. The Yellow Rose was canceled after one season of twenty-two episodes.\n\nIn the summer of 1990, the series was rerun again on NBC along with the short-lived Bret Maverick starring James Garner.","popularity":2.689,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1957,"logo_path":"/nmcNfPq03WLtOyufJzQbiPu2Enc.png","name":"Warner Bros.
