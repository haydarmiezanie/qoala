It was the last game show hosted by Gene Rayburn and aired as filler programming on the American Movie Classics cable network.\n\nThe concept of the game was for famous celebrities of the past to correctly answer questions that pertained to a scene of a movie. Correctly answering a question allowed the panelist to see a part of the scene and a chance to identify the title of the movie. Panelists played for home viewers with the viewer whose panelist guessed correctly winning a grand prize.\n\nThe regular panel of the show consisted of veteran New York Times movie and theatre critic Clive Barnes and longtime To Tell the Truth panelists Kitty Carlisle and Peggy Cass.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
