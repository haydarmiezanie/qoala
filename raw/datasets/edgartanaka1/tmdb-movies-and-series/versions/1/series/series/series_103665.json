At least, it was ours at some point. The UFC has spent the 2010s sacrificing much of its magic in its desperation for mainstream legitimacy. This sport once transcended our world. Now, it is our world.","production_code":"","season_number":1,"show_id":103665,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},"name":"Fighting in the Age of Loneliness","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"name":"YouTube","id":247,"logo_path":"/9Ga8A5QegQmiSVHp4hyusfMfpVk.png","origin_country":""}],"number_of_episodes":5,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Fighting in the Age of Loneliness","overview":"Throughout its history, mixed martial arts have served as a refuge for people disillusioned and confounded by the world at large.
