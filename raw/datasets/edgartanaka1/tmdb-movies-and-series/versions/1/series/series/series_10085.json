It was aired in Japan as a separate rebooted transformers series, though in America, the English dub was presented as a sequel to the previous series, Transformers: Armada and Transformers: Energon by adding dialogue and reusing a number of screens to link elements of the Armada and Energon series to the show, giving the impression that it is a sequel. In the anime, all of the Transformers are computer-generated, while the humans and backgrounds are rendered in traditional cel animation. It is the last series in the Transformers franchise to be produced in Japan.","popularity":6.682,"poster_path":"/ul8l6uP1nUeFKQXiElI6pHzMeat.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2005-09-19","episode_count":53,"id":20033,"name":"Transformers cybertron season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
