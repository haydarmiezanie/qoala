The program, a half-hour in length, began during the 1990–91 NBA season, and was initially hosted by Bob Costas. Costas left in the mid-1990s, and became lead play-by-play voice of The NBA on NBC in 1997. Hannah Storm replaced Costas and hosted Showtime until Ahmad Rashad replaced her as host of the pregame show when Storm went on Maternity Leave in 2001. Storm returned from Maternity Leave in 2002 which meant that her and Rashad would alternate as hosts throughout the season. NBC kept the title of Showtime prior to the 2000–01 NBA season.\n\nShowtime analysts included:\n\n⁕Quinn Buckner 1991–1993\n\n⁕P. J.
