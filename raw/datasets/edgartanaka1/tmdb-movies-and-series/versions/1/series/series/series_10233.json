Unable to produce regular, scripted series, programs such as High Risk were put together to serve as replacements under fear of a two-year lockout.\n\nThe CBS 100% in-house production featured \"high-risk\" stunts and jobs such as Border Patrol agent, automobile repo men, cave explorers, and thrilling roller-coaster testers.\n\nIntended as a two-year commitment, strike or no strike, High Risk received unanimous condemnations and was cancelled after being presented for one night. The show was hosted by Wayne Rogers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1988-10-04","episode_count":7,"id":20251,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
