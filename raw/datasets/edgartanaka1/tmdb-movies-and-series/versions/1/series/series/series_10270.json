The new series joined the many celebrity-oriented reality programs already in their lineup, such as It Takes Two and Dancing with the Stars. It was hosted by Ian \"Dicko\" Dickson. Guy Leech, the eventual winner, or \"Sole Survivor\" of the show, donated A$100,000 to the charity of his choice, Ride Aid Inc, with the other contestants' charities receiving A$5000 each. Although better received than the earlier Australian Survivor, Celebrity Survivor was still only a modest success in the ratings and a follow-up series has not materialised. The Italian version of this format, named L'isola dei famosi, was aired for the first time in 2003 and became a hit show. Currently the 8th edition is being aired on Rai Due. In the 2011's edition of L'Isola dei famosi, Simona Ventura became the first television presenter to be a contestant on the reality show.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":12,"id":20285,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
