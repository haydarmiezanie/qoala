It did not receive a release until 2006 when it was released direct to DVD. The reason why the spin-off was never taken further seems to be because HiT Entertainment did not want it to conflict with their own series Bob the Builder when it bought the rights to Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends in 2002.\n\nUS DVD released as \"On Site with Thomas and Other Adventures\" containing six episodes and UK DVD released as \"Thomas' Trusty Friends\" containing eleven episodes of the series.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qLYHsMqVpPkmWth7Egf5qUNbHJL.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2003-08-24","episode_count":13,"id":151348,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
