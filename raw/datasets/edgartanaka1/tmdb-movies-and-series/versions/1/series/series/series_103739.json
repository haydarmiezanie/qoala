From Executive Producer Ellen DeGeneres and based on the hit U.K. format, this new series offers a voyeuristic look at a variety of real first dates happening throughout one night at the same restaurant. The audience will be along for the ride in a refreshingly authentic viewing experience that plays like a real-life romantic comedy. At the end of each episode, we will find out if the participants want to see each other again for a second date or if they will go back to the drawing board.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aWxkCNRHGbZ8EynJn4X3nnCdPBB.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2017-04-07","episode_count":8,"id":151404,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Reality","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
