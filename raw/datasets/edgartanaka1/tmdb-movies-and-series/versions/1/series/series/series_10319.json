The show featured three contestants who competed to answer general knowledge questions in order to win the grand prize of $5,000 from the show's host, Ben Stein. In the second half of each episode, Stein participated as a \"common contestant\" in order to defend his money from being taken by his competitors. The show won five Daytime Emmy awards, with Stein and Jimmy Kimmel, the show's original co-host, sharing the Outstanding Game Show Host award in 1999.\n\nAs noted in a disclaimer during the closing credits, prize money won by contestants was paid from a prize budget furnished by the producers of the show. Any money left over in that budget at the end of a season was given to Stein. If the total amount paid out during a season exceeded that budget, the production company paid the excess, so Stein was never at risk of losing money from his own pocket.\n\nStein's co-host was Jimmy Kimmel for the first three years. Kimmel left in 2000 and was replaced by Nancy Pimental, who co-hosted the program through 2001. Kimmel's cousin, Sal Iacono, who took over the role in 2002, was the show's last co-host. Although Jimmy Kimmel left the program in 2000, he occasionally made guest appearances afterward, and hosted College Week episodes in 2001.","popularity":2.448,"poster_path":"/yxEQ6S5YdH7HEsR3CcfRWe7arZJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1997-07-28","episode_count":2,"id":20375,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1998-04-15","episode_count":2,"id":20376,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":3,"id":20377,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":20378,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4},{"air_date":"2001-04-16","episode_count":4,"id":20379,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5},{"air_date":"2002-03-25","episode_count":2,"id":20380,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6},{"air_date":"2003-05-08","episode_count":2,"id":20374,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":7}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
