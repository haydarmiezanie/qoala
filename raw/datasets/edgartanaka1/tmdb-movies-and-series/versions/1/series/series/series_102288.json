Their hard external skeleton provides strength and protection and their small size allows them to exploit many microhabitats. In Yellowstone, Steve Backshall reveals how teamwork allows a colony of bees to scare off a hungry bear, and in Australia this same teamwork allows a colony of ants to beat the rising tide. But to unlock the real secret of their success Steve takes us to the Swiss Alps, where an incredible relationship exists between the ant, the wasp and the butterfly.","production_code":"","season_number":1,"show_id":102288,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},"name":"Insect Worlds","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"name":"BBC Four","id":100,"logo_path":"/lYk9QLeOO9RFuDz8pnW8NcoEL8B.png","origin_country":"GB"}],"number_of_episodes":3,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["GB"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Insect Worlds","overview":"Steve Backshall explores the world of insects and their close relatives, the arachnids and crustaceans, in order to find out more about their habits and secrets.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jXb7MS764knsaczRES6sbWgHUDh.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2013-03-13","episode_count":3,"id":148579,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
