The Chicago-based developer has built up a large portfolio of properties and become a multimillionaire in the process. Now he's using his wealth and experience to help others in need. Conlon comes to the aid of struggling property investors whose projects are failing, putting them on the verge of financial ruin. He infuses each project with his own cash, but that lifeline isn't free as he gets a piece of the property and a percentage of the profits in return. With a deal reached, Conlon does whatever is needed to get the property out of the red, even if doing so requires getting rid of the existing contractors and doing the work himself. He falls back on all of his experience to get the properties, which range from single-family homes to multiunit developments, back on track and headed toward the finish line.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2017-03-29","episode_count":4,"id":145446,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"2020-03-04","episode_count":4,"id":145447,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
