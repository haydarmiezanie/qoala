Thinking it's the perfect bridge to dating McKenna, Tucker offers to take care of it until Seth returns -- even though he'll have to keep it a secret since Claire doesn't want it in her house any more than the Reeds do. The iguana turns out to be nowhere near as housebroken as McKenna swears it is -- which makes Claire think that Leon is wetting the bed again. Later, the iguana wets Tucker's bed, and Claire puts Tucker through a humiliating 12-pee program.","production_code":"","season_number":1,"show_id":10095,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},"name":"Tucker","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"name":"NBC","id":6,"logo_path":"/o3OedEP0f9mfZr33jz2BfXOUK5.png","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":13,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Tucker","overview":"Tucker is a television family comedy series that aired on NBC from October 2, 2000 to March 27, 2001.","popularity":1.359,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7928,"logo_path":null,"name":"NBC Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":65431,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sudden Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":37714,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regency Television","origin_country":"US"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2000-10-02","episode_count":13,"id":20042,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
