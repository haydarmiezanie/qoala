The show debuted on September 11, 2006 and is hosted by ESPN SportsCenter personality Chris McKendry. It is primarily a thirty minute program followed by a rerun of the sporting event it is chronicling.\n\nThe first episode of ESPN Classic Remembers aired on the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks and its impact on the sports world. It was followed by a replay of the only edition of SportsCenter to air that night announcing the cancellation of all sporting events for at least a week. That SportsCenter was hosted by Bob Ley and Trey Wingo, who also gave commentary about that night.\n\nOften, the series is used in retrospect following the death of a notable sports figure or a significant anniversary of a major event that changed the face of sports. In 2007, it was used on the 25th anniversary of the Duk Koo Kim vs Ray Mancini fight in 1982 that resulted in Kim's death, and included the airing of the Korean film Champion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
