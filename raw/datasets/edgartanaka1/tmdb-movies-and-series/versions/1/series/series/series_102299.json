Her father is a absent-minded wizard, and has a spellbook. He also brews all kinds of his own brews. However, he has one limitation: he cannot turn strawberries into camels, but he can turn them into dromedaries. Ti-Ka also learns magic from her father, but she only partially succeeds because of her father's absent-mindedness. However, if she claps her hands, she can freeze all people on earth like a statue. When she claps her hands again they start moving again and they think they have slept.","popularity":0.726,"poster_path":"/irgvOzpTloBgaq4vswSGQb8xmy8.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1972-10-01","episode_count":6,"id":148632,"name":"DVD 1 - Mijn vader is een tovenaar","overview":"","poster_path":"/6tb3PIors6Q0JogqWf96LIQiOHH.jpg","season_number":1},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":6,"id":148637,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/irgvOzpTloBgaq4vswSGQb8xmy8.jpg","season_number":2},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":6,"id":148638,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/cttNevNptKzxcAohSAcY4aeuDhQ.jpg","season_number":3},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":3,"id":148664,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/jbJRfKfv08Ryqe1JuQlzj3rmCBR.jpg","season_number":4},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":3,"id":148665,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/nGJbogGTWLXpUddUoOzUSX3ASwS.jpg","season_number":5},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":3,"id":148666,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/fSv6HByA7vUxLHF9mGZ0Y1Xwtr3.jpg","season_number":6},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":3,"id":148667,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":"/2mIy4v1jEmsh6JuGI6GSZKsC5TY.jpg","season_number":7},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":148668,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":"/yCu2MyMZK48ndWRAAHtCBVlBznT.jpg","season_number":8},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":148669,"name":"Season 9","overview":"","poster_path":"/6uMjdFN4zYL8s5PczO38AtJIlES.jpg","season_number":9},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":148670,"name":"Season 10","overview":"","poster_path":"/wn23tU548omtJmlhQeVLrmTwcR1.jpg","season_number":10},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":148671,"name":"Season 11","overview":"","poster_path":"/jBtih7mfHCSYlwzNyqlo1AJjnNU.jpg","season_number":11}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
