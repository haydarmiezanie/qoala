He swore to overthrow the Kims and reform the country. He read the hunger to power in Lee Ha-eung, a humble-looking member of the royal family, and decides to help him to set his son on the throne. Meanwhile, the Kims also find the heir to the throne, using Bong-ryun's special gift. Bong-ryun, the daughter of the current king, has the power of psychometry.
