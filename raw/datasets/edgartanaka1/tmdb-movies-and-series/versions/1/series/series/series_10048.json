The series was created under the leadership of Cecily Truett Lancit and Larry Lancit, at Lancit Media Productions in New York. The concept of a reading series for children originated with Twila Liggett, Ph.D., and Paul Schupbach, of the Great Plains National Instructional Television Library at the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln; and Tony Buttino, of WNED-TV Buffalo, New York. The original team included Lynne Brenner Ganek, Ellen Schecter, and host LeVar Burton.\n\nEach episode centered on a theme from a book, or other children's literature, which was explored through a number of segments or stories. The show also recommended books for kids to look for when they went to the library. It is the third-longest running children's series in PBS history, after Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and Sesame Street. It was also one of the first PBS shows to be broadcast in stereo.","popularity":1.819,"poster_path":"/ndlSMn2zCP6MNIp6OYexGAa1Yj1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lancit Media Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/1obQrU1cAJDWvXwOdqXAoo6Zwmp.png","name":"WGBH Boston","origin_country":"US"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1983-06-06","episode_count":15,"id":75931,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1984-01-01","episode_count":5,"id":75933,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"1985-07-01","episode_count":10,"id":75935,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"1986-01-01","episode_count":15,"id":75936,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4},{"air_date":"1988-08-15","episode_count":2,"id":81090,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":9.3,"vote_count":16}
