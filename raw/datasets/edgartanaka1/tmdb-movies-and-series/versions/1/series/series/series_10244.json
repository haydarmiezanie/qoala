It was taped in Washington, D.C., and nationally syndicated by NBC Universal Television Distribution. The program debuted on September 22, 2002.\n\nThe program usually aired on Sunday mornings before or after the Sunday morning talk shows, usually on NBC affiliates or their sister stations.\n\nChris Matthews served as the program’s moderator and was joined each week by a rotating group of four journalists. Either Andrea Mitchell or Chuck Todd, both of NBC News, would occasionally sit in for him.\n\nAlthough Matthews was also the host of MSNBC’s Hardball with Chris Matthews, the two programs shared no common staff outside of Matthews or editorial input, besides being recorded at NBC’s Washington facility. The program converted to a high definition presentation in April 2013.\n\nOn April 30, 2013, Matthews announced he would be ending the show to focus more on Hardball and writing books. The last show aired July 21.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
