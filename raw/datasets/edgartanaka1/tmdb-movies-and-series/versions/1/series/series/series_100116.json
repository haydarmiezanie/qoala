She is an unconventional division head who believes that an entire investigation can be done in a room and completely rejects the “Showa” concept of legwork. Although Kyoko practically never leaves her room for an investigation, she is able to solve many difficult cases with her remarkable insight and deductive powers. Then things begin with the appearance of the middle-aged Ishinabe Kanta who has finally fulfilled his long-cherished dream to become a detective with his assignment to the Nasi Goreng Division. Ishinabe is full of enthusiasm but even though he appeals to Kyoko about his strength for legwork, she cuts him off and dismisses hot-blooded idiots as unnecessary.","popularity":0.882,"poster_path":"/8vtqqHrb6OSVUTRx1ZxBTFp9kS5.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2016-10-17","episode_count":10,"id":144640,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
