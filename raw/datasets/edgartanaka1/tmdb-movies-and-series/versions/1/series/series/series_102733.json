The unnamed city wherein 2121 takes place is under a hard-socialist rule. If at any time a citizen breaks any of Counsel's numerous rules, they will be expelled to the Outlands-a lawless wasteland outside the city walls, without the benefits of its clean air and water. Inevitably, from the depths of the misery of this society, a revolution is forming. A group called Defiance is planning a complex attack on Counsel, aiming to bring down both the AI and those who serve it. They have spent months recruiting members, turning assets in high places, and cooking up their own brand of digital weaponry-and now it's time to put their plan into action.","popularity":1.448,"poster_path":"/hGZO2I4F7XnwJQngFzRNw1sSWv9.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2020-04-19","episode_count":7,"id":149354,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
