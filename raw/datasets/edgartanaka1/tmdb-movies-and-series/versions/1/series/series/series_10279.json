Produced by ABC News, it was hosted by musician Tom Chapin and created and produced by Lester Cooper. It replaced Discovery, a similar series for children also produced by ABC News.\n\nEach episode of the series, broadcast on Sunday mornings, focused on a particular theme. One episode, for instance, was about snakes, and another was about motorcycles. Chapin would introduce the topic in much the same manner: \"I think a snake is what I'll be. Imagine all the possibilities.\" After that there would be a sort of free association presentation on the theme featuring stock footage, animation, and Chapin's music and voiceover commentary. The quick-cutting, free-association, stream-of-consciousness style of the show caused Chapin, years later on a talk show, to describe Make a Wish as \"a show for six-year old speed freaks.\"\n\nThe series won a Peabody Award for Best Children's Series in 1971.\n\nSome songs performed on the show were written by Tom's brother, Harry Chapin. General composer of the show was Bernard Green, who also wrote the music to the title song \"Make a Wish,\" with lyrics by Cooper, sung by Chapin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
