The show premiered on August 30, 2004.\n\nPauley and other people involved with the show, before its premiere, were not aware of how she would adapt to the medium. Pauley has shown that she can handle serious interviews, but it was not immediately evident if she could hold her own in a medium which is heavily laden with impersonality.\n\nThe show's ratings were not impressive, and the show was canceled, with the final episode airing in May 2005.\n\nThe show was broadcast from the studio formerly occupied by The Today Show.","popularity":1.156,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":65236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polliwog Media","origin_country":""},{"id":65237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Weisman Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":7928,"logo_path":null,"name":"NBC Studios","origin_country":""}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2004-08-30","episode_count":141,"id":20104,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Talk Show","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
