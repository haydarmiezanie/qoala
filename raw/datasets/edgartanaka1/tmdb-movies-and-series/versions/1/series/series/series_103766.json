That's one of the reasons so few amateur restorers succeed and why so many potentially brilliant projects remain on axle stands and under tarpaulins to rust in peace.\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way. Filmed over 12 months mainly in the UK, but also in Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Holland and France, Wreck Rescue features the highs and lows of five very different workshop projects including a very early Frog Eye Sprite, a 1959 Elva 100 single-seater race car and a post-war, 4x4 RAF truck.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h92LC3QF3KN9lRHOZgFX5IUOAx4.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2009-01-01","episode_count":10,"id":151443,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Documentary","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
