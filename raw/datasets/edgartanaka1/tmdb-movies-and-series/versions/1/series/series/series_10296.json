First airing on September 10, 1988 and ending in 1989, it was hosted by actor Paul Provenza. It was created and executive produced by Alan Goodman, Albie Hecht, and Fred Seibert; produced by Chauncey Street Productions, a division of Fred/Alan, Inc., in New York.\n\nIt claimed to utilize grievances made by children mailed to the studio -- each side of a grievance would be represented by a child in the audience, and at the end of their argument, children in the audience would cheer. The \"Judge-o-meter\", a cardboard rendering of an English judge with peak meters for \"eyes\", would measure the decibels of the screaming, cheering children, and the side that generated the most screaming and cheering would win the argument. The \"Judge-o-meter\" system would also be used to \"sentence\" the guilty party -- sentences would be suggested by children in the audience.\n\nThe show also had two courtroom sketch artists during the course of the show, Nobi Nakanishi and Asha Canalos.\n\nDuring commercial breaks, the show would have quick quiz questions for children, about the legal system. Kids Court was part of Nickelodeon's \"Cable in the Classroom\" promotion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
