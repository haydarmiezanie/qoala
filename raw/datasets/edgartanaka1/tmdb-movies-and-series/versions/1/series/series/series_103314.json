There's no discrimination here, as both up-and-coming artists and veteran acts perform. Even the host has a prolific resume in the recording industry: Ray Benson, founder and lead singer of Asleep at the Wheel, has won nine Grammys throughout a career that has lasted more than 40 years.\n\nUnlike Austin City Limits and many other live music programs, TMS gives the viewer unique access to these artists. “I wanted to give our viewers an experience that’s different than when you are out at a concert,” said Tom Hoitsma, the executive producer of the show. “It’s great fun to see these acts live but you can’t really get up close and personal with them at a live show. With the television series we’re focused on delivering a more intimate viewing experience.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8gdoK5QSk1MXqt0CsUuQ63dmDxN.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2010-04-09","episode_count":1,"id":150510,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
