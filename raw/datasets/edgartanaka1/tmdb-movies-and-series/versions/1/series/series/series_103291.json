At Christmas, he was dumped by his partner of four years, Sara Pascoe. Sheâ€™s now performing a hit Edinburgh show that's candid to the point of cruelty about their breakup. I'd fear for the man's wellbeing were his own show on the subject to be eclipsed by hers. Happy to report, then, that it's every bit as good. Not only is Robins extremely forthright about his emotional wretchedness post-breakup, he's also consistently, uproariously funny. The two moods don't contradict, they complement - which is an impressive feat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8ojx5kcf0SvbJ9nU5ToeHN4c2Fy.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2018-12-16","episode_count":1,"id":150478,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
