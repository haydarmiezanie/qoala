It takes the form of a fake anthropological documentary as if made by British television. Each show explores one subject from it's history through to the present covering 6 or 7 topics (or subheadings) using voxpops and informed opinion to inspire comedy sketches and unflinching rants from numerous created characters. The third series is performed by comedians David McSavage, John Colleary, Pat McDonnell and Dermot McMorrow among others. The topics we are covering this year range from Media and Politics to Christmas and Family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1923,"logo_path":"/ilgktofJY7OsURHfccJrug4GKdQ.png","name":"RTÉ","origin_country":"IE"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2011-12-24","episode_count":1,"id":145384,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0},{"air_date":"2009-11-23","episode_count":6,"id":145355,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"2011-01-10","episode_count":6,"id":145358,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"2012-03-19","episode_count":6,"id":145360,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"2014-05-05","episode_count":6,"id":145361,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
