Fitting in to a new hometown is hard enough without having to hide a secret so huge as zombie parents. And the methods Lulu, Bruce and Frankie must invent on a daily (even hourly!) basis to keep the truth under wraps are a constant source of adventure and hilarity. For the Champ Clan, life in Tubbershandy can get pretty interesting - and weird.","production_code":"","season_number":2,"show_id":102678,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},"name":"Drop Dead Weird","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[],"number_of_episodes":52,"number_of_seasons":2,"origin_country":[],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Drop Dead Weird","overview":"Three Australian siblings move to a bed and breakfast in Tubbershandy western Ireland with their Zombie parents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r2qnUe58VsF2zlIQuBkM3EGyORt.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2017-09-25","episode_count":26,"id":149271,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"2019-07-16","episode_count":26,"id":149275,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
