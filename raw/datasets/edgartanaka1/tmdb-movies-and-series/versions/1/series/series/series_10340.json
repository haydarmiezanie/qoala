However, in this show she is not restricted by a budget and showcases food from more upscale eateries. She tries different types of food from each place she visits, and gives a \"Hot List of Values\", which includes some of her favorite places visited from $40 a Day. The show airs on the Food Network and is her fourth Food Network program. It first aired on August 26, 2005. She provides voiceovers for most of the show and is shown at only one or two places. Her husband, John Cusimano, usually accompanies her at the one or two restaurants she visits per episode.\n\nForty-one episodes were produced during the series' first two years; Ray stated on a September 7, 2007 appearance on Late Show with David Letterman that she had just completed work on twenty additional episodes, which had begun airing the previous week.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2005-08-26","episode_count":15,"id":20401,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"2006-04-14","episode_count":13,"id":20402,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"2007-07-04","episode_count":8,"id":20403,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3},{"air_date":"2007-02-13","episode_count":6,"id":20404,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4},{"air_date":"2007-09-04","episode_count":9,"id":20405,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
