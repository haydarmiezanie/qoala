Also in the regular cast was Stewart Ginn, and later Noeline Brown joined. The comedy of the series came from the clash of two generations living under one roof, a situation possibly suggested by UK comedies Steptoe and Son and Till Death Us Do Part. Many episodes were written by Ralph Peterson.\n\nWhen Chater left the series in 1968 the remaining cast was spun off into a new series titled Rita and Wally but it was found that the character of Dominic was integral to the comedy of the situation and the series ended a few months later.\n\nThe series had a run of 88 episodes under the McGooley title. Rita and Wally ran for 23 episodes.\n\nThe program was rated number 24 in 2005 television special 50 Years 50 Shows which counted-down Australia's greatest television programs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1966-09-01","episode_count":16,"id":20412,"name":"? season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1967-01-26","episode_count":48,"id":20413,"name":"? season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2},{"air_date":"1968-02-01","episode_count":24,"id":20414,"name":"? season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
