The format was similar to ABC's The Bachelor, although contestants competed for dates with racing stars, like NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series driver Jon Wood, and not for their hand in marriage. The show, which debuted in June 2004, was immediately panned by the network's viewers, who complained that the Fox Network-owned channel was sinking to a low level by caving into the reality dating shows that are so popular in the present day.\n\nThe show disappeared from SPEED's lineup in late Summer of 2004, never to return.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
