Scott has an extra \"y\" chromosome that supposedly gives him a criminal predisposition - although he tries to go straight, he is genetically incapable of doing so.\n\nRoyce's original books were : The XYY Man; Concrete Boot; The Miniatures Frame; Spider Underground and Trap Spider, though he returned to the character in the 80s with The Crypto Man and The Mosley Receipt.\n\nRegular characters included Scott's long-suffering girlfriend Maggie Parsons; British secret service head Fairfax; Detective Sergeant George Bulman, the tenacious policeman who wants nothing more than to see Scott back behind bars; journalist Ray Lynch; gay photographer Bluie Palmer and KGB chief Kransouski.\n\nIn 1976 the first of Royce's novels was transferred to British television by Granada TV, in a three-part adaptation with Stephen Yardley playing Scott. The adventures of Scott caught the public imagination and ten more episodes followed in 1977. He is often co-opted into working for shadowy civil-servant and MI5 officer Fairfax. Doggedly on his trail is his nemesis Bulman and his assistant, Detective Constable Derek Willis.","popularity":0.989,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1976-07-03","episode_count":3,"id":2921,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":"1977-06-27","episode_count":10,"id":2922,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
