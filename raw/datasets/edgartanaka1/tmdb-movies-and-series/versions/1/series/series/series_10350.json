The program was created mainly as a make good by Winfrey, who had offered her program's archive to Oxygen upon taking an ownership interest in the network, but later changed her mind about airing her older episodes and decided to offer another contribution to the network beyond same-day repeat airings of her show, which were likely disallowed by her syndication contract with King World.\n\nThe program was discontinued on-air in 2006 after Winfrey sold her interest in Oxygen to another party, but the After the Show concept continued as streaming video on the Oprah.com website until the program's May 2011 end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2002-09-16","episode_count":1,"id":143583,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
