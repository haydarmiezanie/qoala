One person simultaneously takes two others on a date. Each of the daters chooses a place to go, and the person running the date dismisses the person he/she likes the least. Each of the competing daters also has a time-out card. When used, the card allowed the competitor twenty minutes alone with his/her date.\n\nAn international version called Globally Dismissed aired as well. It is essentially the same thing as the original show, except each person comes from a different country. Dismissed was revamped, and eventually replaced by the series Next.\n\n‚ÅïReruns of Dismissed have started up again as of October 23, 2006.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"seasons":[],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
