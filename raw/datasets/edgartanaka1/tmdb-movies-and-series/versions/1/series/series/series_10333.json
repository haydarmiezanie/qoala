The TV program is notable for being among cartoon director Tex Avery's final works. Avery died during production in 1980 and the show was broadcast for one season on CBS.\n\nAs it was produced in Australia, the Cartoon Network and later Boomerang broadcast was sourced from PAL masters, rather than NTSC masters like many other Hanna-Barbera productions. Each segment has been shown separately in-between shows on the Boomerang Network.","popularity":0.894,"poster_path":"/lpD85O0rPPxqn3FGlHrnFUO8Xai.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":12,"id":107811,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/lpD85O0rPPxqn3FGlHrnFUO8Xai.jpg","season_number":1}],"status":"Ended","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
