The series showcased the short sci-fi films of both unknown and known filmmakers, giving rise to the channel's own Exposure Studios. Hosted by actress Lisa Marie, the films presented a wide range of science fiction subject matter. The series received poor ratings and was canceled in the fall of 2002. The series was originally shown on Sundays at 10:00pm EST and was repeated the following Saturday at 2:00am EST, later on the time was changed to 11:00pm EST and still repeated the following Saturday well after Midnight, which probably is a major reason for the poor ratings this show received. The series also had two guest hosts. Terry Farrell would host the \"Best of Season One\" episode and director Kevin Smith hosted the \"Star Wars Short Films Showcase\".\n\nThe Sci-Fi Channel had also struck a deal with AtomFilms which gave them the broadcast rights of any of Atom Films' new science-fiction acquisitions, as well as all science fiction films currently in their library, for Exposure.","popularity":1.096,"poster_path":"/oTHrAYv4Gr071LwMmIt8UMzGv5u.jpg","production_companies":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2000-04-05","episode_count":22,"id":20245,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":20,"id":20246,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2}],"status":"Returning Series","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
